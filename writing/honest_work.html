Vic Simmons&ensp;||&ensp;&ampamp 010
</p>
</div>
<div class="writing">
<p>
“Excuse me sir! Excuse me sir!”</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Vic
looked up with a jolt. A construction worker in a lime green long
sleeve shirt and paint-splattered faded blue jeans was trying to get
his attention. The man was a mess of grey dryer lint hair erupting
from every orifice and glasses so thick he could probably see through
walls. He was standing with several other workers young enough to be
his grandsons. They were smoking a joint. Vic had noticed the smell
from across the parking lot and when he saw where it was coming from
made a note not to pay attention to them. But now this fossil was
trying to capture Vic’s attention. 
</p>
<p>“Sir!”
</p>
<p>“Yes?
Me?” Vic locked eyes on the elder one. 
</p>
<p>“Yes
sir, you. You look like some one who is deep in thought.” 
</p>
<p>“Yes,
I am. I am in very deep thought.” 
</p>
<p>“Well
enjoy your evening young man.”</p>
<p>“I
will, you as well.”</p>
<p>The
old man received the joint, took a drag, and passed it. Vic took
quick look at the rest of the old man’s company, saw they were
uninterested in him, and then hurried to get into the hotel before
the rain broke again. 
</p>
<p>As
he settled into his room, Vic thought of the old man as one of the
“prophets” he continued to cross by in life. Throughout his life
he had these uncanny encounters where strangers would make peculiar
comments that would then resonate with his psyche. He had crossed by
people in airports, planes, street corners, museums, cafés, or
anywhere he was alone. One told him about what real love meant and
how it was nothing he could imagine. One told him about disarming
roadside bombs in Iraq and how he had a thirty-day life expectancy.
One was just waiting for him with a pair of pants that he always
wanted. He was certain that the old man who spoke to him, who
interrupted his solemn walk across the Best Western parking lot, was
one of these “prophets.” 
</p>
<p>“I
am a man deep in thought,” he said to himself. 
</p>
<p>“That’s
why they sent me here.” 
</p>
<p>He
had been on the road for several months and several thousand miles.
He lived out of his car and hotel rooms he could afford when he had
the money. Most of the money he made had to be saved for his family.
He went where the jobs were and he would go until there were no more
jobs. 
</p>
<p>He
looked out his window and saw the back side of a Waffle House. The
dumpster, a few milk crates, and a dirty mop were nearly arm’s
reach from his window. The clouds were parting and a few rays were
making past the Waffle House into his room. He left the curtains open
while he unpacked his belongings: canned green beans, instant
noodles, instant coffee, B vitamins, a laptop, a few literary
magazines and paperback books. He sat at the desk and thumbed through
the magazines. A short piece about a guy finding twigs in his mailbox
that were actually microphones from the FBI made him laugh. If only
the author knew how bad things really were. Vic had a meeting in the
morning with the deputy director of the Defense Threat Reduction
Agency (DTRA) in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Just before this job he had
a long stay in New Mexico talking with Los Alamos National
Laboratory. Before that it was Oakridge National in Tennessee. He
never got to talk to the boys in Langley but he made sure the
security guards got his manuscript. 
</p>
<p>“Just
keep writing those checks you alphabet bastards and I’ll tell you
what you’re thinking before you can dream it up.” He looked out
the window, the clouds were coming back. 
</p>
<p>“I
am a man deep in thought,” he whispered. What god or devil gave him
these powers he hoped never to find out. 
</p>
<p>“Oh,
DTRA what did you do? What could I possibly do for you? Is there a
broken arrow for me to find? Are there undeclared supplies of sarin
that need to be found? Oh, I know! It was DOMANE, the Discovery of
Medical Countermeasures Against Novel Entities! That’s where you
screwed up. The whole world is locked up washing their hands until
they bleed and all you wanted was another year of funding.” 
</p>
<p>He
took a mini legal pad from his laptop bag and began to scribble. 
</p>
<p>“Wuhan
Institute of Virology”</p>
<p>“Satellite
guided microwave signals for RNA disruption” 
</p>
<p>“Hydroxychloroquine
vitamin D zinc cocktail” 
</p>
<p>He
stopped. A flash of lightning pierced the clouds. He had to think of
something that would scare the pants off of DTRA. The pandemic was
losing its sting on the public and they weren’t going to cut him a
cheque for a hundred grand unless he could sell them an idea they
never thought of. It had to be something that would stir up the
fringes on both sides—believable, terrifying, and fundable. He
added “Vaccine mandates” to his list. 
</p>
<p>“If
you think vaccine mandates are bad wait until you hear about . . .”
Another flash of lightning. 
</p>
<p>“CRISPR
treatments for the elite. If the virus came from a lab and humans
will always be susceptible to the variants, then the only lasting
cure is to alter the human DNA. Of course, this won’t be available
for the masses.” His mind wandered off at the horror of this idea.
It was plausible. He could see the riots now. 
</p>
<p>Fat
drops of rain began to hit his window. He pulled the curtains closed
and turned on the TV. The satellite signal came in slow, and when he
found the local news a woman of indeterminant ethnicity was
describing the weather. 
</p>
<p>“Clear
skies this evening and sunny going into the weekend.” Thunder broke
overhead and the image pixelated. Vic looked at the assorted canned
goods he had organized on his dresser and decided to go spend some
U.S. government greenbacks.  
</p>
<p>He
ducked out with his copy of Hegel’s “Reason in History” from
the Library of Liberal Arts. In less than thirty paces he was under
the awning of the Waffle House. He snaked around to the front
entrance just as a full deluge was unleashed. Inside two groups of
construction workers were eating. One group of bright orange t-shirts
and one of neon green long-sleeves. The oranges were gathered around
the cash register. They were stretched thin and the cleanest thing
they touched that day were the white receipts they were patiently
waiting to pay. Behind the counter was a young black hidden behind a
hat, apron, and powder blue surgical mask. His eyes were sincere when
he said, 
</p>
<p>“I’m
sorry for the mix up, what was your order again?”</p>
<p>Off
the clock and completely calm, the nearest orange explained. 
</p>
<p>“Okay
that’s right.” The black worked the register like a savant. 
</p>
<p>“And
you had the pancakes, bacon, coffee, and a Mountain Dew?” he asked
the next orange, who nodded politely. 
</p>
<p>In
the far end of the restaurant, in a booth bordered by mountains of
dirty plates, near the edge of the counter seats, were the greens.
They were hardy and alert. The stains on their clothes were different
from the oranges. Vic headed towards the edge of the counter seats to
sit by himself. Closer to the greens he could feel the rhythm of
their conversation. They were planning the next day, week, and
project. They must have worked something highly skilled or extremely
dangerous because they were in concert with each other. 
</p>
<p>“He
tried to take half an hour from me,” said the youngest  looking.</p>
<p>“We’re
not going to let that happen,” said another.</p>
<p>“I
already talked to him about that,” stated the third. And the fourth
closed the issue with, 
</p>
<p>“It
won’t happen again.” 
</p>
<p>A
forkful of hashbrowns, a drizzle of maple syrup on the eggs, slurping
the last of the Mountain Dew from the too-much ice, and a gulp of
coffee later. 
</p>
<p>“When’s
the contract go out?”</p>
<p>“Wednesday.”
</p>
<p>“We’ve
seen a draft.”</p>
<p>“It’s
got everything we want.”</p>
<p>Vic
took a seat, took out his book, and started to read but was quickly
interrupted by the young waiter from the cash register. He had
hurried over and said something unintelligible from under his mask.
He looked apologetic. Vic didn’t understand a word. The waiter
mumbled again. 
</p>
<p>“No,
it’s okay, I’m in no hurry,” Vic said. The waiter looked at him
for a moment and then left to tend to the oranges. Vic didn’t care.
How could he possibly care about anything that some burger punk
waffle jockey in an apron had to say? He had the attention of The
Regime. He was followed, watched, tailed, bugged, and x-rayed from
space by the alphabet soup MK Ultra nightmare machine and was still
getting away with six figure checks he quickly changed into LINK,
moved to a hardware ledger, and droned to Switzerland where his wife
and children were waiting. He didn’t care how long it took, or if
the stove exploded, or if they were two minutes from closing, he was
going to get some dirty cheese burgers and some bubbly sugar water
because he needed a break from this pedal-to-the-floor red-line life
of lying to the government. He picked up his book and resumed
reading. 
</p>
<p>Several
minutes passed before he looked up again. The oranges were heading
into the rain and the greens were heading to the counter. The young
waiter from the register was free at last to attend to something
else. He strolled back over to Vic carrying a laminated placemat
menu, his eyes more cordial and less serious than before. Before he
could hand it over, Vic placed his order. 
</p>
<p>“Two
cheeseburgers, with pickles and onions, and a Sprite.” 
</p>
<p>The
waiter scribbled the order without hesitation. 
</p>
<p>“We’ll
get right on that.” 
</p>
<p>He
scurried to the stove where the cook was aggressively scrapping it
clean, handed over the order, and shot back to the register where the
greens were waiting to pay. 
</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,
how was everything?”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“I
didn’t order extra bacon,” as the oldest looking one pointed to
his receipt. 
</p>
<p>“This
says I had four waffles, I only ordered two.” 
</p>
<p>“I
only had hashbrowns and coffee.” 
</p>
<p>“Can
you break a fifty?”</p>
<p>Vic
looked over at yet another wave of bad orders that needed to be
straightened out. It made him glad he didn’t have to deal with such
things. He turned back to his book and tried to forget everything but
what was in his hands. 
</p>
<p>After
several more pages of reading and pondering how Hegel or any
philosopher ever got the balls to describe the nature of the universe
without any objective facts to back them up, the food arrived. It was
exactly as Vic had dreamed it would be: hot, greasy, compact, a
little crispy, a little sour, and, with a tall glass of pop, a little
sweet. Vic glanced around. It was just him, the waiter, and the cook.
He noticed the cook only briefly when sitting down, but now he was
taking the stage. 
</p>
<p>“Cheap
dirty Mexicans not tipping and leaving a mountain of dirty dishes.
Cheap mothafuckas!” the cook let rip. The waiter looked on
distressed at the cook. Vic looked straight ahead at the tiled wall,
not thinking, not caring, but only enjoying being there. In this
brief moment he became a simpleton completely disconnected from the
white-knuckle game of defrauding the United States government. He was
nothing but a grease stain in a grease stain. If he was bound to that
greasy counter, he would consider himself a king of infinite burgers
if not for those dreams. Too many nights he closed his eyes only to
see the grand caper falling apart and a thousand long knives coming
for his throat. But not at that moment. At that moment, there was
only the joy of a hot tasty meal that someone else prepared. 
</p>
<p>Vic
looked out the window and saw a BMW turning into the parking lot.
Then an SUV turned in. Then another SUV, and another followed.
Suddenly there was a small parade taking a snack break detour outside
the window. The waiter and the cook were stunned. 
</p>
<p>“Shit!”
exclaimed the cook, “I bet it’s a bunch of kids! Fuck man where’s
the next crew? Ain’t our shift up?”</p>
<p>The
waiter, upset as well, had a plan. 
</p>
<p>“I’ll
just tell them we’re only taking carry-out orders.”</p>
<p>“Shit!”
</p>
<p>Vic
took a long drag of soda, leaned back on his chair, and watched the
doors. Out from the cars their parents paid for, came the youth of
America. Vic could remember a time when people used to say that
“children are the future.” Now time has stopped and there is only
consumption. He starts to feel his age when he remembers when “youth”
and “optimism” went together. Those two haven’t gone together
in years. Half a dozen dead-eyed children of the grave came through
the doors while the rest of the caravan waited in the safety of the
cars. They looked hungry for a glimpse of adventure—not a real
adventure of course, but a glimpse of one. They wanted to hide behind
laminated menus, hold their phones over the booth, and see someone
who was free of the cage. They just wanted to capture a few moments
of something “unscripted,” something “real,” but most
importantly something that would make them love the cage they lived
in. They needed to look at the outside world and be scared of what
could happen to them if they were to leave their cage. They loved
their cage and needed to know that the cage loved them; it’s for
their protection, it would never harm them, of course it loved them.
So, there they stood, a failed generation, looking for some fun at
Waffle House off some stretch of the American Autobahn in the middle
of a thunderstorm. And you know what? The Waffle House was all out of
fun. 
</p>
<p>Before
the low testosterone leader with the weak jawline could even say a
syllable, the waiter cut him down. 
</p>
<p>“Only
to-go orders,” said politely.</p>
<p>The
cook had his back to the crowd and focused on the stove. The caged
birds tried to sing a few notes to understand the situation and were
calmly rebuked with a reminder that</p>
<p>“We’re
only doing to-go orders.” 
</p>
<p>The
waiter’s voice made Al Roker sound like Method Man. The cook fought
back a laugh. He couldn’t believe it was actually working. He
covered his mouth and dashed into the storeroom. The birds looked
around. Vic picked up his second cheeseburger and looked down at the
birds, thinking to himself, 
</p>
<p>“That’s
right crackas, you heard the head-nigga-in-charge, ‘only to-go
orders’. Ignore the
Jewish/Muslim/Turkish/Italian/French/Canadian/Native American citizen
who is clearly eating in-house and was served by the waiter who
is—yes you are correct—is refusing to serve you because in case
you forgot China destroyed the world, Trump won, and Epstein didn’t
kill himself, did you get all that? Are you having fun yet? Did you
take enough pictures? Did you generate enough free content for your
gods?”</p>
<p>They
started to piece something together; something that told them they
weren’t going to find fun here. Vic took a quick look at the Meryl
Streep of Waffle Houses who had his best “I don’t make the rules,
I just got to follow them” look on. The birds were beaten. They
departed, filed back in their cars, and fluttered on down the
highway. 
</p>
<p>The
cook peeked out of the storeroom. 
</p>
<p>“Shit
it worked. Thank God! Where the fuck is the next shift?” 
</p>
<p>“I
don’t know I just want this day to be over.” 
</p>
<p>With
an empty plate, Vic moved towards the register and fought back his
grin. He knew he wasn’t one of them. He knew that the joke they
pulled wasn’t for his amusement, but for their survival. Yet he
hoped that they could share the punchline with him, that he could be
part of the fun that just happened. The waiter rang up his check, 
</p>
<p>“$12.07”</p>
<p>“For
two cheeseburgers and a Sprite? Holy God that’s expensive,” Vic
thought. He paid and tipped. He looked at them, hoping to make
eye-contact long enough to smile at their joke with them, but they
didn’t look at him. The two behind the counter talked about their
plans for the evening, tomorrow, the week, and the rest of their
lives. They made it all seem possible. All they needed to do was to
do it. Vic tucked his book into his raincoat and caught a glimpse of
the menu he didn’t bother looking at. He was stunned. He had been
overcharged by about 100%. He tried again to look at the waiter and
the cook, but they couldn’t even see him now. They were lost in
lard-vapor dreams and Formica aspirations. Vic tried one more time,
and realized he’d become a blur to them. After a while Vic went
out, left the Waffle House, and walked back to the hotel in the rain.
