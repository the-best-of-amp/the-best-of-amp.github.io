<b>CASE STUDY, PART I</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">The
thing he always remembered first was the loudness of it. The animal
shock. Then the fact that in jumping backwards he’d torn the
headphone jack out of its socket. Then, the mad scramble</p>
<p>for
the keyboard, the ALT-F4 ALT-F4 ALT-F4 ALT-F4.</p>
<p>Then
blankness.</p>
<p>After
this painful series of mnemonic thunderclaps, his mind would go over
it again, calmly, more methodically. It would start from the
beginning.</p>
<p>It
had been a Friday night. Henry had been browsing 4chan since he got
home from school. Not long after dinner he opened a thread about
creepy things people had come across on the internet. It was amusing
and interesting. One person said the weirdest thing he’d seen was a
schizophrenic woman’s YouTube channel devoted to documenting her
‘liposuction slaves’. Another set of anons had a brief
conversation about a strange ‘Lolita virtual reality game’ they’d
played together.</p>
<p>Then,
tucked in the middle of the thread, there was a cryptic bait post. It
was saddled—almost to the point of snapping, it felt like—with
dozens of replies.</p>
<p>He
flicked his cursor over some of them. One post asked ‘What’s with
all the replies? Can someone explain?’ and another simply said
‘Don’t even bring that shit up man’ with a sweating</p>
<p>Pepe
picture.</p>
<p>The
post itself was strange. Used weird codewords he didn’t recognise,
like ‘6@6@6@’. Henry scrolled further down. The thread ended
abruptly. It refused to refresh. No new posts appeared. It must have
been deleted immediately after he’d opened it. At the very bottom
was a post containing nothing except three web links. It was
addressed to no one. They can’t be replicated here, but this is
vaguely what they looked like:</p>
<p>https://um.pl.xo.b/54341/</p>
<p>https://um.pl.xo.b/32894/</p>
<p>https://um.pl.xo.b/92346/</p>
<p>After
a moment’s hesitation, Henry highlighted one of the links, probably
the last one, right-clicked and pressed ‘Open in New Private
Browsing Window’.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">The
links Henry opened are ultra-illegal. We shall have time to analyse
what happened to him afterward, but first the phenomena with which he
unwittingly involved himself should be explicated.</p>
<p>Colloquially
they’re called ‘Hell streams’. They carry harder sentences on
average than the possession and distribution of child pornography.
Supposedly there is a unique livestream for every inhabitant of Hell
(no one has checked them all, the number of links runs into the tens
of billions), but, as Thomas Kunzendorf notes, the violently abstract
content of the streams make this hard to verify, and no study has
ever been able to firmly establish a connection between specific
links and individual personalities. The spectacles offered by the
streams are divergent in the extreme. What is uniform is their shock
value.</p>
<p>It’s
difficult to estimate how many people have actually seen Hell
streams. Some have been exposed against their will, via ‘pranks’
and shock sites (a disturbing case involving a little girl aged 6
made to watch by her older brothers is documented in Dowd &amp;
Olson’s Hades and its Discontents, pp. 60-5). Numerous motives
drive voluntary Hell stream consumption, the most common of which are
morbid curiosity and sexual gratification.</p>
<p>The
effect of watching a Hell stream has been described as ‘nauseating’,
‘hypnotic’, ‘traumatic’, ‘soul-shattering’, and
‘addictive’. Their most ‘dangerous and seductive’
characteristic, according to P.T. Aquilino, is their extreme novelty.
While most people close the stream within seconds of opening it (even
this ‘blast of colour’ is potent enough to have long-term
psychological ramifications: see Garner &amp; Cho), for those who
keep watching, they are subjected to a spectacle wherein each new
‘development’ in the ‘action’ invariably outdoes the previous
one. This results in users becoming ‘glued to the screen’; locked
in a perpetual state of bafflement, incredulity, amazement.<sup>1</sup> It is,
as one viewer said, ‘impossible to become habituated’. There is
an exponential escalation in intensity that can go on literally for
as long as the stream is open. Chronic watchers have described it as
like having an ‘itch in their brain’—knowing in the back of
their heads that the streams are always running, that there’s
billions of them always going on, that every waking moment, even when
you’re in fact watching one of the streams (for there are always a
hundred billion more that you’re not watching), there is still
‘some amazing shit you’re missing out on’.</p>
<p>They
are more stimulating than any piece of media created on Earth (this
is now a scientific certainty: Clayton &amp; Bhattarai).<sup>2</sup> In richness
and variety they surpass all worldly entertainment. Nothing can match
them for ‘power of invention’. Some of the language used by my
patients verges on the transcendent. They have described ‘glimmering
red nebulae unfurling in black expanses’, ‘skin-caverns animated
by pain’, and ‘acts beyond all right knowing’.</p>
<p>One
young man compared it to the ‘consecutive split-second flashes of
entire worlds’ one experiences while ‘on the knife-edge of
sleep’.</p>
<p>Because
they are livestreams of Hell, they are infinite. They do not stop.
Everything only happens once. There are no ‘re-runs’. Their
ephemeral quality is, to certain viewers, literally maddening. The
deadly conjunction of ‘fleeting’ but ‘overpowering’</p>
<p>stimulus
bleeds over into compulsive behaviour. A 60-year-old American man was
recently sentenced to a dozen years in prison for recording and
distributing hundreds of hours of footage he’d recorded on his work
laptop. The desire to show others and communicate the gravity of what
one has seen is common among viewers of Hell streams. It is a major
reason why they get caught.</p>
<p>For
some the fear of judicial punishment actually adds to</p>
<p>its
narcotic tang.</p>
<p>There
are several legal rationales underlying the criminalisation of Hell
stream viewership, namely that it is offensive to human dignity,
fundamentally sadistic, etcetera. Theologians are regularly called
upon as expert witnesses at trials to emphasise the religious
unacceptability of the practice. The harsh prosecution of
streaming-related offences is not at odds with public opinion: Nagata
estimates almost half the American population would approve of a
sentence of life without parole for people caught watching Hell
streams. Sociologist Judd Lamb has explained this primarily in terms
of a revulsion toward—and a fear of—the confirmation of any
person’s status as irrevocably damned. It would be mortifying, he
suggests, for a grieving mother to hear, at the funeral, of her son’s
restfulness, only to discover later, from the next-door neighbour’s
son, that he is in fact languishing forever in undying flames. Alex
Soresina, by contrast, attributes this widespread antipathy solely to
the media’s construction of the average ‘Hell stream viewer’ as
a particularly depraved kind of pervert.</p>
<p>Viewers
offer a variety of rationalisations for their voyeuristic behaviour.
Common arguments include: ‘They are in Hell, they deserve to be
there anyway’, ‘If God did not want people to watch he would not
have made them available’ and ‘It is morally no different from
the visions experienced by saints and mystics in the Middle Ages’.
Controversially, Donald Lutz has argued that these justifications
hold water. ‘What has dictated theological consensus [on this
matter] is not reason,’ he says, ‘but social propriety.’ A
recent story from the papers illustrates an interesting diversity of
moral opinion:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.6cm; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
A young man in M—’s eastern suburbs has been charged with
accessing and reproducing live images of Hell. 21-year-old Cory Pike,
who was arrested outside his A— home last Sunday, says that he only
wanted to, quote, ‘document a reality which everyone ignores.’
Police say he faces a minimum sentence of 18-months imprisonment if
convicted.</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.6cm; background: transparent">
Pike’s defence attorney alleges that his client ‘became obsessed’
with recording and archiving live-streamed footage of Hell out of a
‘humanitarian impulse—the same urge to bear witness that
compelled US servicemen to take photographs at Auschwitz.’
Prosecutors counter that comparing base voyeurism to the actions of
GIs in the war is misleading and offensive.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">The
internet serves, on this issue as well as many others, as a useful
sounding rod for people’s more secret and, perhaps, more authentic
thoughts. Counter-cultural and transgressive opinions about Hell
streams are frequently expressed on anonymous forums and imageboards.
References to one’s own viewership, however, tend to be oblique. As
an example, in response to a post describing guilt about a
nondescript ‘sin’ on a Christianity-themed imageboard, another
anonymous user (with a ‘reaction image’ attached to his post
showing a painted depiction of a sad, severe-looking Christian monk)
began his reply with the phrase, ‘if you’re talking about having
seen what I think you are . . .’ and proceeded to talk in circles
around his own ‘struggle’ with the matter. Other posts assert the
subversive social potential and even edifying effects of Hell stream
consumption:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.6cm; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
of course govt doesn’t want you to see it, they don’t want people
to realise chirst [sic] is king and change their ways, don’t want
them to stop being good little sinful consumers, controlled by their
appetites</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">A
popular superstition online (though to what extent it is taken
seriously by the users is hard to tell) is that watching, or even
seeing a screencap taken from a Hell stream, irrevocably damns or
‘reprobates’ you. A classic ‘troll’ is to fabricate benign
images that ‘look like’ stills taken from a Hell stream. This has
resulted in a culture of calling out such images as ‘fake and
gay’—sometimes even ones that turn out to have been authentic.</p>
<p>On
the deep web, on imageboards hidden from web scrapers, where taboo or
illegal topics can be discussed more openly, conversation, by turns
heartfelt and farcical, on the problem of evil, the nature of sin,
and the morality of damnation, as well as therapeutic discussions
about the deep impact Hell streams have had on</p>
<p>people’s
lives, take place without fear of social retribution. Many credit it
with motivating them to go to church. Others describe themselves as
irreparably damaged, and blame exposure to Hell streams for the
disintegration of their mental health and their relationships. Once
or twice in my research I have encountered threads where people claim
to have identified someone they knew—</p>
<p>a
deceased relative, or an old acquaintance—on the streams.</p>
<p>Heated
religious debates are endemic. Because Hell streams constitute the
only direct and broadly accessible empirical evidence for the
supernatural, a subset of users (known colloquially and somewhat
affectionately as ‘autists’) spend their free time poring over
stream content in order to discern which religious tradition best
accords with the observable facts of Hell, or, more often, to
cherry-pick evidence in favour of their pre-existing view (and
against the views of others). Imageboards devoted to Hell stream
subculture are divided into religious factions or cliques, each of
which have developed their own corpuses of ‘infographs’ and
‘copypastas’ meant to prove their creed and disprove the others.
Christian and Muslim faithful constitute the majority of posters, but
there are sizeable minorities of Buddhists, Jews, Sikhs, Gnostics,
and even atheists, who maintain that the objective existence of Hell
or a ‘Hell-like’ realm does not necessarily prove the existence
of a theistic God: the agent responsible for its creation could just
as plausibly be a powerful but cosmically contingent entity or, if
the universe is a simulation, an artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>(As
an aside: the Abrahamic doctrine of man’s fallen nature would not
fail to gain some credibility in the mind of anyone who browsed these
forums. Petty arguments about the racial, national, sexual and
religious ‘make-up’ of Hell are common, and posters often tarnish
the damned with offensive race or sex-based slurs. Sexually perverse
commentary is not uncommon. Users talk of becoming devoted to
particular ‘victims’ they find attractive. One anonymous poster
confessed to his obsession with footage of a boy undergoing extreme
‘cosmic pains’. The fact that damnation was eternal meant that he
would never be lacking for novel tortures involving his ‘favourite’.
For this user, all earthly sexual stimulus paled so much by
comparison that he failed to be aroused other than when he was
watching footage of his ‘beloved’ boy being subjected to
unimaginable cruelties).</p>
<p>By
this point the reader might be growing curious as to whether or not I
have ever seen a Hell stream, and if so, what I thought of it and
what its effects on me were. I have. At the University of</p>
<p>M—,
under police supervision and with a coterie of counsellors in
attendance, I and a group of undergraduates from various disciplines
were treated to a rare ‘random viewing’ of an in-progress stream
(as opposed to a carefully selected, pre-recorded one). Obviously we
all had to go through numerous psychological exams in the months
leading up to the viewing. On the actual day our supervisor warned us
about the potential content of the stream, what our reactions might
be, and gave us several chances to withdraw. After we’d been
lectured for about two hours and had signed all the waivers and
disclaimers they handed us, the lights dimmed and the stream finally
began.</p>
<p>In
our lives we have all seen things that are specifically offensive to
our constitutions, almost hand-picked by fate to throw us off balance
and disturb us. I call these ego-dystonic memories. They are sights
or sentiments we are annoyed at ourselves for having seen or
overheard and that we would prefer to forget. I won’t bother to
list any examples since they are often highly personal and what might
seem significant to me will be banal to you and vice versa.</p>
<p>For
my part, the footage I saw not only replicated this sensation but
multiplied it a thousandfold. In my mind I’d had lurid ideas about
what the content of Hell streams might be. I anticipated certain
obvious and stereotyped images. In retrospect my expectations were a
cartoon. Those fifteen minutes have filled me, permanently, with a
deep sense of the poverty of the human imagination. Above all, I
shall never forget the noise.</p>
<p>The
experience has given me two contradictory impressions about the
people who watch these things. On the one hand, I have no idea how a
human being can possibly enjoy that. When I had more naïve ideas of
what Hell streams involved (and I thought my ideas back then were
extreme) I could sympathise, to a degree, with people who derived
pleasure from watching them. Who satisfied not just their curiosity,
but all manner of other desires. They seemed at least like human
impulses. Dark, but human. When I saw what actually goes on in those
streams, I lost all ability to relate to those people. That sort of
thing, I thought, could only be the preserve of a very remote kind of
life, such as what Aquinas wrote of fallen angels. On the other hand,
I now understand, intimately, the irresistibility of it. Almost
something you are compelled to do irrespective of any personal
feelings. It is like a portal into the unimaginable.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>CASE
STUDY, PART II</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Henry
had no way of knowing, of course, that ISPs immediately flag all
connections to IP addresses that host Hell streams. Generally, there
is a certain lenience. If the connection happens only once, the
incident is treated as a mistake and no action is taken.</p>
<p>Two
months later, Henry visited the site again. This time he opened not
only one link but several. He sat and watched for several hours and
took screenshots.</p>
<p>The
juvenile court sentenced him to two hundred hours of community
service and mandated that he undergo therapy. On that basis he was
referred to my care.</p>
<p>With
every patient I begin by asking a variety of questions. Among other
things I asked Henry whether he felt any shame about what he’d done
(Yes), whether he was suffering from nightmares (No), whether he was
anxious about his future (Yes), whether he took any sexual
gratification in watching the streams (No; actually Yes; actually
it’s complicated), and whether any of his relationships had
suffered as a result of his actions (Yes). I asked him to explain to
me what had made him go back and watch the streams a second time.</p>
<p>Henry
told me that he found the fear intoxicating. The heavy breathing
before he opened the links, the anticipation. He asked me whether I
had ever, as a child, been traumatised by a scene from a movie or TV
show. I said yes. He then asked me whether, as an adult, I had ever
tracked down said pieces of media and rewatched them. I said yes. He
told me that the sensation is similar, but much more heightened.</p>
<p>I
looked down at my clipboard. ‘Do you think,’ I began, ‘that
when you have access to a computer again you’ll be able to—to
resist the urge?’</p>
<p>He
was silent for a time. He looked out the window. I looked with him.
We watched the cars pass. They trailed long shadows in the late
afternoon light.</p>
<p>I
will close this essay with a passage from Thomas Kunzendorf, who took
an intimate interest in the altered mindsets of compulsive Hell
stream viewers. It records his final conversation with an anonymous
young man who later mysteriously went missing:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.6cm; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
. . . He [Kunzendorf’s patient] saw the world now, he said, as a
sort of thin skin—of the kind that might develop over a glass of
milk left out for hours in the sun—laying above a much more
pungent, viscous, bubbling reality. The world of pencils, mattresses
and traffic lights was so threadbare, he realised, that it barely
counted as an individual existence at all. The slightest knock
against the glass would tear it open and dissolve it.</p>
<br/>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.6cm; background: transparent">
He said, continuing, that he couldn’t help but have a mutated
outlook on life, considering what he had seen. Even the most
marginal, unimportant city bum was potentially—would probably
become—a black category of life that outclassed, in its volcanic
alienness, all the chthonic deities of ancient cultures. The dullest
personalities were under-rated in their terrible future splendour by
even the most esoteric descriptions that human hands had committed to
paper. Cashiers, accountants, cheerleaders, were all eternal horrors
in gestation. For a very brief period, incomparably, impossibly
brief, people lived like people. In reality these people were eggs,
tiny, tiny, tiny eggs, the size of mites or lice, that would give
birth, at one point in time, all of a sudden, to writhing
monstrosities beside which whole galaxies would seem like dust motes
and to whom the entire lifespan of the universe repeated 100100 times
would not even begin to seem significant. An entire universe of
suffering-but-mortal flesh would never, under any calculation, be
able to match a damned soul for total amount of pain experienced.</p>
<br/>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.6cm; background: transparent">
Before we finished I asked him how I should digest this insight into
reality that he had gained by grazing inferno with his fingertips:

This ‘gape-inducing’ quality lends itself to social propagation.
Strizver has documented the existence of ‘dares’, ‘challenges’
and ‘reaction’ videos. Basic MS Paint images listing ‘rules’
for ‘games’ (such as the dubious ‘find your fetish’
challenge) are regularly uploaded by users onto forums and
image-sharing sites.</p>

It is possible to apply for stream access on legitimate academic,
scientific or theological grounds. The hazards posed to researchers
have gained more attention in recent years following the shock
suicide of Jane Beversluis.</p>
