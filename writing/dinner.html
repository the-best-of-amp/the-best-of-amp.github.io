Dinner

<p>
Spit in my soup. It’s been a few minutes since we were served, but
it only took me an instant to see it: spit in my soup. My date, so
far unaware, is enjoying the start of her meal while I’m stuck
trying to figure out why I’m in this situation—why I’m sitting
across from this near-stranger while someone waits for me to swallow
up their ugly little glob of sputum. So I sit here—like an
idiot—perplexed and just faintly upset. Part of me wonders whether
I did something to the waitress, and another part of me starts
forming the words that I’ll have to say to this girl who’s gaily
eating across from me. 
</p>
<p>I
try to replay every moment up until now: walking in, being seated,
speaking to the waitress, waiting here in awkward pre-dinner
communion, then being served. In it all I fail to see the moment when
I suddenly set things off. It might just be the way I look, or
something about my demeanour. So now I pick apart every little bit of
my exterior: the clothes I’m wearing, the way I’m sitting, my
manner of speaking, how I walk. Though I continue to reach dead-ends
on why I’d be singled out, I arrive at one conclusion: I deserve
this. Not that I want it, no, but that something about me exudes
weakness, that I let someone think they could do this to me. So I
start to feel differently, but still I just want out.</p>
<p>Finally
my date clues in. Half-jokingly, she asks “Is there something wrong
with your soup?”</p>
<p>“Yeah
. . .” and I hush my voice, “I think someone spit in it.” It
comes out almost pleading, as if I’m begging her to tell me what to
do.</p>
<p>Immediately
her brow crinkles, while her mouth twists into a little grimace
around an urgent “What?” and that’s when the waitress comes
back.</p>
<p>“How
is everything so far?”</p>
<p>When
I turn to look at her I search for something in her face that’ll
tell me whether she’s in on this. That searching turns into a
confused hesitance while my date waits for me to act and I wait for
the waitress to crack. And it still feels like I deserve this, like
I’m waiting on this woman to tell me what sin I’ve committed.
Then my silent beseeching is interrupted: a little sibilance cuts
through the formal murmur of the restaurant, like a hose sputtering
steam. For a second I think the waitress has started to hiss at me,
but then I see past her. On the other side of the room is a door to
the kitchen, which for a moment is broken open by a waiter shuffling
plates. Through the doorway I catch a glimpse at a line cook whose
eyes are fixed on me as he stifles giggles behind an ugly, mocking
sneer.</p>
<p>At
that I feel a pang shoot through me. The obvious first words,
“There’s spit in my soup,” come out with accidental, haughty
indignance, which transforms my confusion into typical impotence as I
stand up in a rush and make the standard declaration that I won’t
be paying for this. My date is taking a back seat to it all, and she
might as well; I’m the one making a scene, and she’s stuck going
along with it because there’s no recourse from these sorts of
things.</p>
<p>The
waitress gives me an “Excuse me, sir?” with a shocked,
unbelieving air—taken aback as if I’d just uttered a threat. But
then she makes a quick study of the soup and the all-too-obvious
slime shifts her tone to supplicating.</p>
<p>I
look to my date: “I’m leaving. We’re leaving,” and while she
hurriedly, awkwardly grabs her jacket, I can’t help but glower at
the kitchen door. Her little hand at my back urges me towards the
exit and I feel myself bristle at the assertion. But I avert my gaze
and do my part, nearly leaving my date behind as I stride away from
the situation. My teeth are grit. I see myself suddenly becoming the
stereotypical offended wimp who huffs and leaves. In retrospect, I
can see it on myself from the moment I came in. I see what the cook
saw, and I get why he thought he could do this. I see the universal
contempt that I made myself a vessel for—made by being so terribly
weak.</p>
<p>While
I make my escape the sound behind me changes. It’s not the subdued
chuckling from before, but a whole swell of laughter that overtakes
the restive din. It shocks me and I give a start, stopping in place.
For a moment I believe it’s the entire restaurant erupting at me,
but really it’s just one voice, just the line cook. A flush of heat
runs over my back and through my chest up to my face. I feel a little
tingling premonition in my shoulders. My right leg won’t stop
shaking. It’s at the door that I turn back.</p>
<p>I’m
standing in place when I bellow out. A short, echoless “Fuck you!”
that dies on the wooden walls. It fills up the whole room like a
black cloud, out of which eyes suddenly stare, transfixed on the
scene between me and the cook. Whoever wasn’t already clued in
starts to whisper about what the hell is going on, but nobody really
knows. Even I don’t get it, nor do I see where it’s headed. The
waitress makes a move to get away, pulling her little notepad up to
her chest like a rosary. From my sides a manager with a stern face
and the biggest waiter seem to be closing in on me—ready to sweep
me out the door, as if I’d be cowed so easily. Ahead of me is the
rising, wailing laughter still spewing from the apron’d hyena who’s
now standing in the doorway of the kitchen. His whole chest heaves in
rapturous gasping as he directs all the air in the room down onto my
head. No one knows what to do about him. Then there’s me. From
somewhere beyond me I hear a low and serious “Sir,” but they
don’t catch me as I close the distance to the kitchen.</p>
<p>There
the cook is still in his giddy hysterics, propped up on the jamb of
the door while he clutches at his chest and howls from under his
involuntary squint. I’m just an arm’s-length away and closing the
gap with an angle from elbow to knuckle up into his jaw that sends
his opposite temple into the edge of the frame. And then he’s below
me, no longer doubled over but crumpled up. He’s now limp, and I
see a little trickle of red coming from his temple. Rage gives way to
reason while I stand over him. Everything condenses as I hear the
shrieking or shouting all around and I feel various hands grip my
shoulders and I’m no longer in control and I wonder:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Why
did he spit in my soup?</i></p>
