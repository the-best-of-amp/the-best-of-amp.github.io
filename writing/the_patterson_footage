The Patterson Footage

The Patterson footage was shot October 20th 1967. It features a large
furry animal walking upright through Bluff Creek, near Yakima,
Washington. The animal looks like Bigfoot. The men who shot the
footage insisted it was Bigfoot, never recanting their story.
Predictably, the film has been called a fraud. Numerous experts have
assessed the film, yet there is no consensus as to its authenticity.
None of that is important. Any polemic bickering amounts to pissing
in the wind. What DOES matter is the moment when the animal looks
over its shoulder and peers into the camera; a vestige of the unknown
stared us directly in the eyes, and impassively looked away. It could
have bowed. It could have run. Instead, it calmly dismissed us—as
if to say, <i>you don’t exist</i>. For all our high and mighty
rhetoric about being number one on planet Earth, the supernatural
might as well have spit in our oatmeal.  
</p>
<p>We
collectively sneered. Our egocentric minds recoiled, having been
rebuked by an anomaly. The mainstream media rejected the story and it
faded into obscurity. In short, we couldn’t handle it. To be on the
safe side, we declared it a hoax—another subject undeterminable.  
</p>
<p>What
a blank. That’s the best we can do? How are we going to handle
questions like what’s at the Earth’s core? Does the universe end?
Is there God? Undeterminable, which just means <i>we don’t know</i>.
We won’t believe in something unless the military-industrial
complex uses it to kill us. Electricity existed before its
“discovery.” It’ll probably go the same way with time-travel
and who knows what else.  
</p>
<p>Rather
than declaring anything unorthodox to be witchcraft, we need to trust
the unknown . . . or at least acknowledge its potential. Hell, you
could even call it faith, which to most people means <i>bullshit</i>.
Of course faith has its pitfalls. Both faith and reason are
inevitably corrupted. The difference is that faith sees the world as
something beautiful and temporary; there are powers greater than us,
thus favoring reverence. Yes, reason is far more practical; without
reason there wouldn’t be umbrellas or computers. However, as a
philosophical foundation for society, faith is sustainable. Reason
sees the world as something to explain with measurements, such as
“How big of a hole will this bomb make?” 
</p>
<p>But
hey, cheer up—once in a while we give mystery its due by being
strange ourselves. Look at Stonehenge. It was built to pay homage to
death and the moon. That’s neat. Nowadays there are places like The
House on the Rock in Wisconsin and The Church of the Sacred Heart in
Rome. These places are full of wonders and they leave a person in
awe—that’s what we need more of. There is a lack of
generation-spanning super weirdness. Instead of reinventing wedding
invitations, let’s build some underground labyrinths. How about a
city that runs on magnets? It would be great to see geometric shapes
make a comeback, like some giant spheres or polygons. It’s as if
our concept of creation is a two-bit motel, with carpeted bathrooms
and no vacancies. Let’s build a fort instead and invite Bigfoot.</p>
