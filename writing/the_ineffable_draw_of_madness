The Ineffable Draw of Madness

<i>
It is not immaterial that madmen were included in the proscription of
idleness. From its origin, they would have their place beside the
poor, deserving or not, and the idle, voluntary or not. Like them,
they would be subject to the rules of forced labor. [...] The
necessity, discovered in the eighteenth century, to provide a special
regime for the insane and the great crisis of confinement that
shortly preceded the Revolution are linked to the experience of
madness available in the universal necessity of labor. [...] Until
the Renaissance, the sensibility of madness was linked to the
presence of imaginary transcendences.
</i>
</p>
<p>	—
Michel Foucault (<i>Madness and Civilization</i>)</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">You
have known your vessel is flawed, so why not take some of the control
back? Start a new system up with a madness program, version 2.0. It
would seem that there always happened to be a part of your person you
didn’t understand. A condition in your heart where you cannot lift
heavy things without falling flat on your face and laughing. Everyone
else seems to scowl and curse. There appears to be no control—but
why shouldn’t there be? Why can’t you, say, start twitching your
neck every 15.3 seconds? A nervous tic motion of the head, to the
left. Or furrow your brow when another someone says
belong/start/help/sale/eat or any number of other things. Or run a
little circle around your temple with your pointer finger when
everything feels disastrously sane. Knock your head against walls,
tell everyone to “Fogeddaboudit.” Just leave places where and
when you want to.</p>
<p>But
to become mad, to understand madness, we have to also see that this
routine is taxing. Like anything else, if you are to feel mad you
must practice, practice, practice. For you are mad, you have just
learned very much to control it. You know what you know and there
isn’t a way to unlearn it, but you may accept, with madness, that
this is not real. Say it to yourself: <i>It’s okay, this isn’t
real</i>. Don’t you feel better if not significantly worse? It’s
okay, it’s been said by people things get worse before they get
better. You would trust them, wouldn’t you? <i>This is not real</i>.</p>
<p>And
this phrase, this one simple phrase carries a lot of weight—as
simple phrases do. In fact being mad is to know the importance of
onephrase. How others, any others really, may pass on through and how
one specially chosen phrase may mean a whole assortment of things.
And repeating it to yourself in the shower or on the bus is a good
way to build significance. Which is another step on the path to
madness, talking to yourself while others can hear. It is the most
socially daunting and sometimes, anxiety-wise, demanding of the to-be
mad, but repeat it to yourself: this is not real. You may wish to
skip the social utterances until a later period in the madness regime
also, if you do so wish, because this is your madness. Not that you
are special, you are only special in the way certain bodybuilders are
special—it’s strangely a similar routine.</p>
<p>So
work on those calisthenics and physical twitches—don’t worry,
you’ll get them down. Sometimes you can practice by pacing
anxiously or clasping your jaw or in other larger physical actions,
such as spending a whole day hunching slightly or spontaneously
letting your neck muscles go limp. Try to follow with your eyes your
own head as it bobbles around in the breeze. And remember: if madness
was easy to pick up, everyone would be doing it.</p>
<p>And
don’t think of madness as a very freeing lifestyle choice, as, in
its strictest terms, the world is defined into even more pronounced
strati. There is a reason most are locked up: the world will become
so comprehensible that you will start receiving an overwhelming sense
of freedom, a tetherless tie to what the idea of freedom could be. A
world without strengthened proposals and routine . . . but you’re
not there yet. To continue, you must work mentally hard as well. You
must, as a means of understanding, chase after boredom with a
measuring stick. Start to worry about the sickness you have put
yourself under, whether this will be a way to make you happy. In
which you will tell yourself: you are more happy when you’re
unhappy—when you know you are slightly happy you can only be
jealous of your unhappiest self. Madness is knowing that there is not
much to gain in the first place, and you must believe this.</p>
<p>And
after a while your madness will help explain much, like how that
dripping faucet plinking in the sink always sounds like a tiny voice
whispering in your head&zwj;—a voice that you can never quite understand
what it’s saying. As you go to turn the faucet knob tighter for the
fifth time, you will see a reflection in the knob’s small handle
and see the small person that’s been inside all along. So monitor
your madness diligently. Watch for things askew, but do not attempt
to fix. That 3 on the side of your building that’s turned and looks
more like a W? Do not turn it, just watch and watch and think and
think. And know the difference between madness and other maladies.
Example: a crazy person will yell, scream at you on the street. Yet
you are quiet, not saying a word for ten years—now that’s
madness. However, most people cannot say nothing. So say the same
thing like a fool. <i>This is not real</i>.</p>
<p>Start
walking late. You start walking at 2 a.m. to make sure most people
are asleep. Yet you are still consistently surprised by the lack of
foot traffic. Aren’t others afflicting themselves with madness? You
know they have been. Walk—look in lit windows and down basement
corridors. Look at the people empty in front of things and passed out
on couches, light still flickering on them. Stop and look and
deviate. For whoever coined the phrase “curiosity killed the cat”
forgot to mention that the the un-curious cat dies too. Also: was a
bore. Gone mad now you are sure you are not boring to yourself, even
though madness is oftentimes very boring. So walk and fight your
pragmatic self as you have been doing. It is a full night and
starting to be cold. Instead of turning and going home where you know
you will be warm, trudge ahead. Pull your arms to your chest and let
the sleeves of your sweater blow in the breeze. Feel the warmth of
your own straight jacket, and fight the thought of how sane you will
feel once you are home.</p>
<p>Your
legs are getting numb, so in their walk they have taken a mind of
their own. Feeling detached from your torso they pull you forward and
forward. This makes you stumble and laugh in your mad laugh. You walk
and think of the lake. It’s only a couple more blocks away. If it’s
winter and frozen over, rub snow on your face and remember what it is
to cry. (For the to-be-mad in arid, dry climates, there are “heat
stroke” and “mirage,” but, if you are truly committed, move
north&zwj;—it is no coincidence that there are a great many Russian
madmen.) You come down a sloped walk to the lake. You smell the
sweetness of the air mix over the waters of the lake and sweep at
you. You see the crescent moon and feel your aloneness, and breathe
for what feels like only the 2nd or 3rd time. You walk down to the
edge of the water and shiver in the now strong breeze. You are maybe
no longer mad. So you fight for it. Stick your face in the lake. You
have forgotten to take your hands off your chest. You have no balance
so you fall in. You splutter, but you can stand. There is an initial
shock, but you slowly realize—now that you’re in it—that the
water is warmer than the breeze, that the breeze chills your wet
clothes.</p>
<p>You
crouch, lip grazing the water, and you hear some voices sing to you
from the lake. You hear and know their song. You know that you must
be mad, hearing this. The songs come from the rocks in the middle of
the lake, big rocks, like planets in the solar system that is the
galaxy of this dark body of water. You have heard them before, but
not like this, never like this. Inspiration, a precept of madness.
The siren song pulls you out, the bodily mass of the rocks acting
with a gravitational force, a current gently pushing at your feet.
Swirling you inwards. You think of how you know this song. How you
know its pull, how you have been warned against it. You have heard
tales of its avoidance, and the honor in it. Yet you float silently
closer, listening. Maybe being dashed on the rocks isn’t so bad.
The song building steadily, the heavy beat of a dying star.</p>
<p>You
are now coming to notice just how bitterly frozen you are. Your jaw
actually starts twitching, your teeth chip at each other. So you
stroke your arms and think how mad you are to be out in this lake and
yet here you are paddling your legs and pulling tighter and tighter,
trying to stay afloat. So, you stop, stop completely, turning your
ear towards the rocks and try and listen. <i>This is not real</i>.</p>
<p>Of
course a truly sane person might just imagine this—real or not—and
think happily that this means madness. You shouldn’t have to
worry—often people train for many useless things. And as you get
older and only walk in the daylight because you take pride in knowing
what it is you see coming, as perhaps later you walk across the well
manicured prairie with a destination in mind, the smell of rich grass
bouncing on your tongue, you’ll get to remember that time you tried
to go mad, and this time you’ll notice that this has already
happened. Old and new become arbitrary distinctions. But that mad
wind, the wind when it blows under your nose and smells like the
second or third time you’ve ever smelled it (it always smells this
way) the breeze reminds you . . .</p>
