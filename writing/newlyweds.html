The winds of change roared through the streets of New York like a
hurricane. The strong current attacked everything without prejudice.
It turned over buildings. It turned over factories, cars, houses,
banks, families, and lives. The dust left in its wake settled on
ruins.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Roland
Myers exited his newly bought car and entered his newly financed
apartment to his newlywed wife. She stood over the oven wearing a red
apron and her strawberry blond hair was pulled back by a matching
bandana. As he approached she slipped on a pair of plaid brown oven
mitts and removed a fresh pan of chocolate chip cookies. He guessed
that she had used the last sugar and chocolate in the neighborhood
for them. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">She
turned to him and jumped in surprise. “Oh Roland,” she said
looking down meekly at the tray.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">“I
thought maybe with all this trouble going on you’d like something
nice to eat.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">She
set the tray down on the kitchen island and began to move the cookies
to a plate. Her hands shook and she began to sob heavily. He ran to
her and threw his arms around her. He held her tight, two new souls
anchored against an invisible storm. He gazed out the window, past
the horizon into the setting sun. He shivered with anticipation, for
the wind he knew was coming their way.</p>
