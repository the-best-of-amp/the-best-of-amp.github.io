Sometimes in a field of flowers, Lumi, Denise and Lorelei would
prance around and pick posies and Lumi’s cat Jisu would prance
along and when it snowed Jisu would watch from inside as they slid on
a sled down the catslide roof of Lorelei’s house and sometimes
after landing they would maintain enough momentum to reach a second
slope without having to stand up and pull around the sled.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Many
times on field trips, Mika would get sick. And now at the museum, he
was on the verge. He was partnered up with Lilja, and they had come
out of the Torture in Ancient Times exhibit to a hall where an entire
wall was dedicated to diary pages from the distant past. One entry
encased above Mika’s head had a pastel drawing of three girls
riding a sled down the roof of a house. Underneath, the label read,
“Lumi and Her Friends, February, 18XX.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Mika
thought, “Lumi and her friends are having fun.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lilja
said, “I’d rather be drawn and quartered than to be put inside
the brazen bull. I’d rather even be flayed alive. No one would
really choose the brazen bull over anything else outside, because you
would at least want to see where you are. So it wouldn’t be a
choice at all. Instead, between the rat box and the Spanish donkey—”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But
Mika was done keeping his cookies in, so he threw up all over the
floor. And also on Lilja. She screamed and gagged and started to cry.
Mrs. Lipponen hurried over saying, “Poor Mika. Get it all out,”
and when he did, she took them both to the museum restroom, leaving
the class with Mr. Lysh.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Mari
asked, “Is he okay?”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Kaisu
asked, “Was there blood?”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr.
Lysh said, “At times there are gaps within our field of inquiry. I
met a mermaid when I was six years old. We were in exile on a boat,
passing through international waters. It happened at night while
everyone else was asleep. I looked out the cockpit window and she was
there staring at me with her yellow lamp light eyes. She was smooth
gray without scales and had webbed fingers like a frog, and she must
have been around my age too, or I supposed so at the time at least.
She stayed on the surface for a few more minutes, then dove back
down, disappearing into the black. Sometimes it’s the only thing I
really think about.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">. . .</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Both
of their shirts were ruined. Mrs. Lipponen had to go all the way down
to the gift shop to buy them something dry and clean to wear.
Meanwhile, they were left in the cold ladies room, half-naked in
neighboring stalls.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">“Sorry
for throwing up on you. It was crowded and I didn’t have time to
plan it through.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">“It’s
okay . . . How long do you think it would take for your eyes to pop
out if you were hung upside down?”</p>
