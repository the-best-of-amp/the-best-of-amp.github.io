I</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">The
last to leave my office, I shut the blinds and feel the night slip
over me in spite of the light outside. Closing the day and
enumerating every set-back and undone accomplishment. Daily
resignation.</p>
<p>It’s
in the bathroom that I stare myself down again, elbows on my knees
and four eyes interlocked in the bottom two inches of the mirror
above the sink. I grimace over a black shit made of Pepto Bismol and
coffee. I’ve rounded the corner to my mid-twenties and suddenly I
look so old—fluorescent light seems to deepen the creases on my
forehead, and from this shivering stoop my eyes are dark and heavy
beneath the shadow of my brow. Across from me I can only see a shaved
ape. A liar. A wastrel. In the office—around my peers—I can put
on a different face, but when I’m all alone there’s nothing left
to prop me up.</p>
<p>Standing,
I rediscover my skeletal thinness as it’s reflected back
half-length in the mirror. Bending over the sink I can see my ribs
through the hole where my collar hangs limp from my neck, taught skin
daubed in a sickly pink-ish paleness. Languid and wavering in place
under the drape of my clothes, like a cancer patient stuck between
hospital rooms. I wonder whether there was a point to all those
comments I got as a kid (and even still) about “filling out.”
Whether it’s compulsion or revulsion or just inability that binds
me into such a gaunt frame. Now the ape looks like a corpse. Or a
ghoul. So I flick out the lights. Leaning back against the door I
collect myself, swimming up above the swarm of thoughts that seems to
find me after each weekly meeting, after each stint in the office.
The smell of my own shit lingers in the air. I give up and I creep
out.</p>
<p>Empty
halls. Orange sunlight. Slant shadows and mechanical stillness. All
the machines sitting idle emitting a subtle collective hum from the
de-peopled labs and offices. The little whir of computer fans that
seeps through the walls. Buzzing electronics on the powered-down
lasers and microscopes and vacuums. The hollow soughing of air ducts.
But in spite of the apparent isolation it’s almost guaranteed that
somewhere in the building someone else is still puttering away,
drafting lines to a thesis or a code or turning dials and making
readings—at any hour. Unlike me they’re making progress. They’re
still here because they have something worth doing. I’m still here
because it takes me time to muster the courage to leave my desk, to
say “I’m done” after doing so little. And it gets darker as I
reflect on that. I watch the blue of the sky vanish into greyness
behind the monolithic walls outside. Again and again I notice just
how gigantic and terrible all these buildings are, their sheer walls
of brick and stone and concrete that dwarf all the trees, towering
and demanding surrender. Here I am, swallowed whole.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Eight
o’clock. Still lingering in the office hallway, but now slave to
the sick churning in my stomach. Looking forward to a meal waiting
pre-packaged and frozen back at home: a bag of dumplings that was
stamped and filled and crimped in a factory somewhere, and which I’ll
shovel in mounds down my throat. But before that there’s a walk
ahead of me, and already I have a vision of what else is waiting for
me: the clothes strewn about, the dirty tissues overflowing from the
trash, papers scattered, dust collecting—a dirty hovel where I eat
and sleep. The only place of reprieve is my bed: two blankets that I
launch into face-first, trapping the anguished squirming that I can’t
hold back at home, burrowing and gripping like a frustrated child. In
that linty pile I can close my eyes and know that no one else can see
me. I can shut out the world by force and resign myself to another
night of dreams. Vivid dreams. Dreams that run on incomprehensible
logic. Dreams that punctuate these otherwise indiscernible days.
Dreams that terminate in half-awake hallucinations. In the mornings I
so often wake just to close my eyes again and put the night’s
scenes on repeat. It’s not waking up that’s hard, it’s getting
out of bed.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">II</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">On
my back in the lunch room, seven-thirty, Friday night. A light on
behind me, I’m on the couch. Beside me—on the coffee table
between me and the big window&zwj;—is an empty plastic tub, which half
an hour ago had my dinner in it, which I’m picking out of my teeth
now, sliding my tongue along the grimy ridges of my mouth. There’s
nothing to look forward to. All I’ve got in my head are the ugly
continuations of arguments that keep pointlessly spiralling. When I
stare at the perforated tiles on the ceiling I see clouds of red and
blue scattering between the holes&zwj;—I can focus in and out and watch
them appear and disappear. I feel full. I feel awake. I feel empty.</p>
<p>Closer
to eight-thirty it dawns on me: at nine the liquor store closes. The
rest of the day had been building up to this moment, but I hadn’t
realised it. There must have been a silent pocket in my stomach that
had hollowed itself out for just this reason. I think about the
paltry minutes it’ll take to pack up and bike home—I can get back
by quarter-to—but I’ll need to walk from my place to the
store—ten minutes if I’m fast. So with an exacting rhythm I pedal
home, gliding through intersections with automatic precision, cutting
important seconds off of my commute. I keep eating clouds of
mosquitoes but I’m fast and my bike ride is like a trip down a
river.</p>
<p>It’s
muggy out and I don’t know what time it is, so once I’m home I
barrel through the front doors fumbling with my keys and searching
all my pockets for my wallet and my headphones and my phone making
sure I’ve got my ID and wondering, still, if I have enough time.
But once I huck my things through the apartment door (and forget to
lock it) I see that it’s only 8:42, which gives me plenty of time.
In spite of that, I feel the anxiety building as 9:00 approaches, and
a few steps away from my door I notice how itchy I am and how hot it
is which is making me sweat which probably reeks and how my scalp
feels like it’s crawling and I’m scratching everywhere.
Open-mouth chewing my gum and somehow there’s confidence under it
all, so I double back to hang my jacket by the door, and then leave,
again, deciding I don’t care how I smell so long as I make it in
time. 
</p>
<p>8:43
and I’m lurching down the sidewalk like the star in a
Patterson–Gimlin film, this tight feeling knotting itself into my
brow, apishly picking at my crown, turning my nails black with crud.
I’m sure I’m making good time but every minute screams at me and
I think of all the things that could slow me down, walking down
streets of people I know and hoping to God I don’t see them because
sweating eyes-wide in the street and muttering “sorry, the liquor
store is gonna close” would make me look like a louse—something
much smaller than the ape I feel like. But the air feels good with
the menthol on my tongue. Making progress.</p>
<p>The
blocks evaporate in front of me until there’s just one left and I
check my phone, finally, and it’s 8:54. At that the anxiety sloughs
off of me and I feel the little rush of confidence in knowing that
I’m going to make it—I can even see the doors now. It’s a calm,
thoughtless trip through the front and to the rack with the cheap
wine, cash-back at the till ($40), back out the door, gripping the
bottle by the neck through my bag, feeling myself calming down and
welling up with the confidence that budded earlier. It makes the walk
home different: taking the main street, eyeing people and passing
through crowds, slowing down a little. I have a loose hold on the
plastic bottle in my left hand and I feel my right hand opening and
closing as I think. Strangers becomes extremes: women whose bodies I
digest with my eyes, and every man a wimpish thug. A glut of
confident, hateful anomie. Something tantalising and surreal about
it, thoughts ricocheting around my skull in placid silence, a bundled
enigma that passes in arm’s length of all these people. Then,
finally alone, behind locked doors and closed curtains, stripping
nude and gulping between shudders. A rushed shower, re-dressing, and
out again.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">In a
few hours it’s all obliterated. (<i>How much have you had to
drink?</i>) Memories that mean nothing—a smear of faces and drinks
and scenes. Lips that press outside, negative space. Glasses
clinking. Deliberate looks. Handing bills to a prattling junkie,
opining about my father. A girl whose name I can’t remember and
whose mouth feels like a void. The drunk Quebecer jabbering in
French. The strangers who know my face, who know my name. And they
all leave me. Nothing left but brief, transient touches, evaporating
on dewy skin, evaporating into the fog of declining nights.</p>
<p>The
walk home goes on without memory, just tableaux of garbage and
concrete, hidden under the oppression of drunkenness. A world that
swims, sublimating in the morning to reveal: Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Lying alone, staring up at the same spackle ceiling as
yesterday and yesterday’s yesterday and so on, each morning a
lossless replica of the last one. A night worth little more than a
dream.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">III</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Rusted
minivans. Babies in strollers. Dogs on leads. FAT MAN ON BIKE,
spandex bib. “Historic district.” Elderly women with tan-wrinkled
fat arms cushioned against their sides. Girls with dyed hair, women
I’d fuck, memorising bodies and faces, running home to come into
the sink with their afterimages still painted on my eyelids. Half-day
shadows dwelling on sidewalks. Coffee getting cold. Books unread.
Not. Feeling. Anything. Just friction burn on my cock, ache of my ass
in a seat for an hour, the weird swell in my eyes pushing out at my
temples. Just these physical things that chase me, run me down to
ageing oblivion. Drinks still in my gut, long past the alcoholic burn
and rush, cheap liquor in alcoves. Pizza boxes, faces I recognise,
grass rushing in the breeze, posters signs flags dresses bodies tails
wheels masks lamps locks reflections. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Little
bugs on the window I want to squash with my thumb, one by one, make
little splotches on the glass, dead little swarms, miniature lives. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Pink
purse against a black skirt, designer sweaters in the dollar store,
platform shoes, hijab, N95. Tattoos and crosses and rainbow
knick-knacks. Tiny dog with no nutsack, sewn shut—furry eunuchs
everywhere. The impish dyke, jeering smile, looking in at me from the
sidewalk. Stinker, stupid kids, “DO NOT TAP ON GLASS.” A crawling
bubbling feeling in my gut, shit clawing its way to my ass. Nothing
stands in the way of nature: shitting pissing fucking sleeping eating
and cleaning it all up, prettying the mess of living, dressing it
like a doll just to dunk it in a festering swamp. Can’t even kill
yourself without shitting your pants—I could blow my brains out
right here right now in this café and they’d be wiping up turds
mixed with gore.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Go
to the bathroom, walk in on a bum who shouts me back from the sink.
Use the toilet after he leaves and find cum in the bowl. Wipe the
seat and remove my shirt (advantage of individual bathroom), door
gets tried a half-dozen times while I try to shit, startling me into
premature pinches always worried the lock won’t hold. Sign up on
the door reads “LOCKED IF HANDLE DOESN’T TURN” but people keep
fucking trying and pushing and straining against the door and I’m
scared to be caught half-nude mid-shit. I smell my own sweat below
the anti-septic soapy reek of the room—I like it but wipe it out
with wet paper towel. When I’m done a certain girl is gone—tall,
dark hair, different outfit from yesterday—but maybe she’s
shitting in the other bathroom next to me. Scared to meet her gaze, I
keep seeing her around, makes me forget what I’m saying. Makes me
wonder whether she can read “PERVERT” written on my face when she
sees me.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Pile
of dead bugs below the window. If I focus I can see my reflection in
the glass.</p>
