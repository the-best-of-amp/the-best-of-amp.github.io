A Journey Through Cyberspace and Into Your Lap

Optical disks whirl, hard drives search and spin, various fans of
different speeds and sizes do their best to prevent complete
meltdown. It doesn’t matter: she’s coming. All his life, or at
least the past 3 months of it, nothing has meant much but this, and
at last he nears a culmination. Eccentric synth music gallops like a
free horse as Rich Hartman presses the final power button. Ready to
go. Various company stickers and badges litter the wirey room and the
surface of antique computer cases, each crammed with bits and bobs
that barely work, but together forming a sort of mega-cyber-choir all
singing the same scream. Towels line the doorway and windows, like a
suicide before you could do it in various cooler ways. A half-eaten
meal, cobbled together by someone foreign to the idea of food, sits
in a bowl on the floor, green peppers, raw. The installation of Wine
completes just as the computers reach their breaking point, the fans
try to breathe, but only moments are given in between births of code.
He knows it’s going to be a complicated voyage, things could go
wrong, dependencies, dependencies of dependencies, dependencies
of—you get the point. 
</p>
<p>Rich smacks the
skeleton case of a failing computer, somehow restarting the dying fan
into a frenzy of worse but functioning noises. It has to go perfect,
there are no second first impressions, only second impressions. A
bird cage nearby rattles and squawks adding to the commotion and
noise pollution. The smell of humidifying bird poop in a rapidly
warming room permeates, but is easily ignored by Rich, used to and
quite comfortable around such odors. His white baseball cap sits
backwards, perfectly complementing, he thinks, the baggy cargo shorts
and graphic tee he has on of his favorite penguin. A computer dies,
but not for long, not being allowed to experience the coolness, the
stillness, that exists in not existing. Knocks on the cheap wooden
door to his room come with decreasing patience, no answer. Eyes, or
rather, fractions of eyes peek through cracks and small holes he had
previously made in the door—thrown keyboards, kicks, and sometimes
headbutts having carved them there. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><i>It’s installed
now, no going back, no crying, please, let’s not cry</i>, he thinks
to himself. The massive amalgamation of energy in the room, powering
computers, powering Walmart fans, powering a server stack used for
nothing but Minecraft, all of this now radiates a desert-like mirage
of heat. Rich sits on the floor rocking next to his 4:3 screens, also
on the floor, now sputtering to display a video call software, with
compromises clearly being made as to which one. He types in a
username and waits, rocking, he waits until his Casio watches (two on
each arm) and Lenovo ThinkPads (librebooted of course) all agree that
the time is exactly 3:00 AM EST. “California girls . . . ” he
sighs to himself as he clicks the call button with his cursor shaped
like a Minecraft sword. A face pops up. A flame pops up on one of the
auxiliary computers running what looks like generic brand Microsoft
Word with various conversation topics typed out in bullet points. “Hi
Sarah!” he practically yells to the various mics, one of which
probably works and is probably hooked up correctly. The receiving end
of his message hears him clearly enough, along with what sounds like
someone constantly blowing onto the mic, a bird squawking, and loud
motherly concern. “So cool to see your face!” he says with both
eyebrows glued to the top of his head, grinning. The speakers don’t
work but it doesn’t matter, he’s gotten this far, and really he
doesn’t even need to hear what she has to say. 
</p>
<p>Dollar store power
strips, plugged in to dollar store power strips, all without surge
protectors, quietly melt as Rich continues, “Soooooo, anyway, do
you want to play League of Legends like usual, you are so cute by the
way ahaha.” Bird noises change from begging for food and attention
to agony. <i>The smell is kind of bad in here</i>, Rich thinks. The
knocks on the door have stopped. He drags her face over, through
various monitors and laptops, twelve in all, to a large TV dangling
overhead looking down on him, a CRT now dripping in the heat. “So
glad you’re not a thirty-year-old dude.” He says it playfully,
intelligently, humorously, as the floor beneath him collapses into a
smoldering pit of burning battery acid and silicone. Tarred and
feathered with melted plastic and bits of jagged steel he can only
think to himself how great it would be to get a pentakill while being
held in her arms.</p>
