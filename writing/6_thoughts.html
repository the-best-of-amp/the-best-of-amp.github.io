<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>A
pill that eliminates the need for sleep</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I’m
not talking about meth. I’m talking about a pill or a treatment
that alters your DNA so that the need for sleep is just eliminated.
You might feel a little tired, but then you can sit in a recliner and
read a book for 30 minutes or soak in a hot bath, and then feel
refreshed enough to keep going. I hear folks talk about ways to stop
ageing or to cure cancer. Fuck that shit. Never sleeping is the game
changer because everyone would have to have it. Imagine you are in
job where one of your co-workers doesn’t have to sleep. They come
to work early, send emails in the middle of the night, work all
hours, and still have the energy for their friends and family. How
can you compete with that? You would need whatever they were on. The
more I think about this, the more I think this pill would be a
massive economic boon for the whole world. People are driving at all
hours of the night, wearing down the roads, wearing down their cars,
there would have to be good TV shows on all the time, sporting events
would have to occur all the time, and so on. There would be no
cyclical routine to our day, it would just go. And back to the
acceptance rate. It would be exponential-exponential. All it takes is
one guy taking it, and then in 6 months the whole world would be on
it. You couldn’t be left behind. You couldn’t be one of the few
people left in “zombie sleep” land wasting away a third of your
life while the idiot next-door neighbor works 3 jobs. The economic
effects are mind-boggling. Keep your eyes open for drug and
healthcare companies that may be developing this. I haven’t heard
of anything close to this except that stuff DARPA developed during
Desert Storm, but I think that was some type of THC/amphetamine mix
for soldiers.</p>

<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Bring
back Pontiac</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">When
will we know the economy is really good? When General Motors
reintroduces Pontiac—that’s when we will be pushing through the
economic stratosphere. I remember when the Concord was retired and I
thought that really sucked. Why can’t the elite business travelers
boom around faster than sound and rattle the windows of the little
people below? Right now I know of one company that is working on
bringing back supersonic commercial flight and I think that is tits.
But the return of Pontiac is really going to be what knocks your
fucking head off. The Firebird and Trans Am will be soaking panties
and driving the local Five-O mad. But here is the kicker: those
badass handlebar-moustache muscle cars will return: Fully. Fucking.
Electric. That’s right, space-age electric high tech Pontiacs!
Fucking Knight Rider! Kit lives! Bring back the Hoff! Real voice
commands, touch screens, self-driving, infrared, satellite,
radar-guided sexiness. You’ll be power-sliding a cloud of smoke and
waving your cowboy hat out the window at some nerd while he
masturbates to Elon Musk tweets in his Tesla waiting for road service
to give him an emergency charge.</p>

<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Harvey
Weinstein Rape Scandal Biopic Rape Scandal</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Okay.
Follow me on this one. So Harvey Weinstein allegedly had sex/raped a
bunch of Hollywood starlets, abused his power, and was a total
monster, allegedly. I get that. I think it is obvious that a scandal
that compelling would make a great movie #metoo. I think it would be
a great way for Hollywood to show it is working on its problem of
equality and give women actors the same respect as men. However, in
order to make this movie, you are going to have to audition a lot of
women. You are going to have to audition a lot of women who are going
to play the part of women who are going to be sexually and
psychologically abused. Do you see where this is going? Some sleazy
Hollywood guys are going to have a golden opportunity to sexually
abuse hundreds of women and say it was “acting.” After the movie
is released and wins all the Oscars, hundreds of women are going to
come out and say: “I was raped by the director!” And the director
will say: “No it was acting! We were having an audition!” If they
are good actors, you won’t be able to tell real rape from acting
rape. Someone is going to greenlight this movie and lives will be
ruined. Keep an eye open for this one.</p>

<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>The
Truth at Roswell</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Here
are some thoughts from a historical perspective. I can remember
growing up and watching the Sci-Fi Channel on Saturday mornings to
see shows talking about Roswell, NM. Fucking A. The aliens had
crossed the galaxy with technology beyond our wildest dreams, but for
some reason they decided to manually park their flying saucer instead
of letting the autopilot plant it on the White House lawn. Then the</p>
<p>G-men
showed up, recovered the bodies, and told everyone it was a weather
balloon. Then somehow in the ’90s a grainy video tape of 4 seconds
of an alien autopsy managed to be released to the public! What are
they hiding? The truth is out there! Bullshit? Yeah, but in a
different way. Apparently there is a known technique that bullshit
artists do involving an event that is around 30 years old. The
Roswell incident was in 1947; a minor story in the local newspaper,
and that was it. Some douche digs it up, interviews some locals with
leading questions, and then writes a book. A couple of new-age
nutbars read the book and now a nothing town in New Mexico is famous
for aliens. It will be interesting if we see some bullshit like this
perpetuated in our time. Here is the last bit on Roswell: The
newspaper article in 1947 said it was a weather balloon that crashed
and the nutbars say it was aliens. According to a Freedom of
Information Act request, it wasn’t a weather balloon or aliens. It
was a high altitude Geiger counter used for measuring radiation in
the atmosphere. I know our government told us they weren’t doing
atomic bomb testing in the atmosphere, but they were and this was a
device used to see how many of the locals might die in 30 years of
cancer because they lived a little too close to Uncle Sam’s nuclear
playground.

<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>The
Last Generation</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
often raise an eyebrow when the Masters of the Universe Silicon
Valley pricks talk about the downsides of artificial intelligence
(AI) and automation. The big threat I hear is “The machines are
going to take away all the jobs and there will be civil unrest, and
then we will have to have universal basic income!” I think that is
a bunch of bullshit. The economy needs AI/automation because we don’t
have enough people. In the brief time I’ve  been working I have
always seen a need for people at all levels of whatever organization
wherever I have been. Most jobs are bullshit too. “Showing up is
half the job,” that is not just a funny expression. It is truth.
Most jobs require little creativity and quickly become routine. AI is
going to be perfect because we are approaching the last generation.
20 years from now our society is going to be a lot less people-based.
In fact the idea of a real person—a physical person in the real
world—will be thought of the same as their digital footprint. I’m
against this idea. That’s why I’m Vic Simmons on the internet: to
preserve the real me. Physical and digital will be one in the same.
The well-to-do Western world is not having enough kids. Mine will be
the last. They will be the last flesh generation. Then time will
stop.

Thoughts</b></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Being
married is a real hoot. There is a woman cooking me dinner and
washing my clothes who isn’t my mom. I love having her around to
say the most insane thoughts to her: 
</p>
<p>“Hey
babe, can you play ‘Pomp and Circumstance’ at my funeral? It will
be like ‘he graduated from life.’” 
</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Can
you boil me down to a big pot of sausage gravy and serve me to our
friends and family at my funeral?” 
</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
like to fix things for my wife. She had this big-ass adjustable
wrench that was rusted shut. I fixed that sonnovabitch no problem.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
like keeping her busy with the jigsaw puzzle that is yours truly. One
night we were eating dinner and our table is near a window in our
kitchen. We are sitting there eating when a fly starts buzzing
against the window trying to get out. I’m closest to the window so
I pull open the blinds and sure enough there is a house fly buzzing
against the glass. My wife says “Do you want a pair of chopsticks
to catch him?” I calmly reply “No, I got him.” Then I slowly
moved my hand in and picked the fly off the glass with my thumb and
forefinger. I held him up for my wife to see he was still alive, then
I opened the kitchen door, and let him fly away. When I sat back down
my wife was just staring at me and said “I can’t believe that
just happened.” I told her “I am the lord of flies.” A few
nights later, she was watching TV and I was working at my desk which
is also in the living room when another fly was buzzing around. He
landed on my lamp, and I reached out and picked him up. My wife
watched as I did this. “Honey look, I caught another one!”
“You’re freaking me out with these flies!” “I told you, I am
the lord of flies.” When you are single and you pick up flies, you
feel like Renfield. When you are married and you catch flies, you are
motherfucking Dracula.
