“How can you taste anything if you can’t smell?” 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>I
was busy in the kitchen making biscuits. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>“I
don’t know, Patrice, you tell me.” 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>She
didn’t say. I could see heat waves off the oven. It was 11:32 on a
Sunday. Long night last night. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>Our
horrible dog kept running around and licking my legs. I put it in the
backyard and threw a stick. The dog jumped and missed. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>Patrice
was inside eating butter out of the container with a spoon. I went
into the day room and looked out the window. The clouds looked up.
There was dust in the air and the window broke. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>It
was so loud and bright I forgot about the coffee table until it
shattered. The sirens started as I hit the floor. Apparently we were
prepared. I wasn’t. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>I
thought it was funny that UFOs looked exactly like on cartoons.
Flying saucers! 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>Patrice
was out back and the dog launched a stick up in the air with its
mouth. She jumped and caught it. “What the fuck?” I ran upstairs
and grabbed the shotgun. If aliens come, I’ll show up. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>There
was a knocking on the door. I was all sweaty. The handle turned.
“Fuck, I forgot to lock the door.” A tall green man stood there.
He had two little gray guys behind him. “Ayy, lmao.” They just
stood there. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>I
unloaded two shells and they just stood there. “Ayy, lmao?” I
slipped and fell back into the kitchen. They came inside. Outside
through the glass door I saw Patrice and the dog. They were dancing
or something. I grabbed a knife and eyed the stairs. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The
aliens came into the kitchen. They opened the oven. One of the little
gray guys tried to pick up the baking sheet and burnt his hand. “Ayy,
lmao!” it cried out in pain. The other gray guy squirted some foam
on the first one’s hand. “Ayy, lmao,” they agreed as they
hugged each other. The green guy looked at me. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>I
put on oven mitts. I took the biscuits out. They gathered around. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>The
green guy placed a device over his mouth and spoke: “How can you
taste anything if you can’t smell?”</p>
