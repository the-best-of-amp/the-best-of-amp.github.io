I. Waters of March by Art Garfunkel</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
1</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Dreamt
I was eating out with YQ. She was saying how she was a good friend
because she was funny. I was amused that she thought she was. She
tried to make me laugh by waggling a cucumber stick at my face. It
wasn’t successful. She got angry.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
2</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Rode
my bike. Neighbors had tethered their cat outside to the fence. Rode
past their house again at night. It was still tethered. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
3</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">OB
called and told me he has a bladder infection. He’s in the
hospital. He sounded really bad on the phone.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
10</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Went
to the bookstore with YQ. Chose not to tell her about the dream. I
was comfortable in the reading chair while she browsed but she ran
into people she didn’t like, so she told them we had to leave and
made me get up.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
11</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Checked
the fridge for milk. Realized it was unplugged and that it had been
for hours. Cradled the cartons of milk and carried them down the
road. Felt bad about throwing them all out at once. Put them gently
in the trash one by one and said goodbye to each.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
16</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">YQ
told me I should listen to “Waters of March” by Art Garfunkel. I
said I will never listen to solo material from Simon or Garfunkel.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
18</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Rode
by the neighbor’s house. The cat was still tethered to the_fence.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
21</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Dreamt
I was eating out with OB. We almost choked on our food while
laughing.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
22</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Heard
something rattling in the trash where I threw the milk out. Waited
for it to stop but it kept rattling on. I didn’t stay or look
inside for what it was.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
23</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">YQ
made me watch a horror movie called “Paperhouse.” It wasn’t a
horror movie at all. I teared up a bit towards the end. YQ didn’t
see. Stupid movie.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
24</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Got
to glimpse a shooting star. Won’t write down my wish, just in case.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
25</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Visited
OB in the hospital. He was even worse. He wanted me to read a
Salinger story about Eskimos to him. He fell asleep halfway through
and snored really loud with the tube I assumed went up his bladder.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
28</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Listened
to the Garfunkel song. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
29</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Sneaked
into the neighbor’s garden and untethered the cat. They saw me so I
ran away. The cat didn’t move or come along. Next time I rode by
the house it was tethered again.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">March
30</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Dreamt
I was still out eating with YQ. She remained angry from the previous
dream. I apologized. She refused to talk. I challenged her to a duel
of cucumber sticks. She looked out the window and didn’t say
anything. I ate the stick whole. She didn’t look.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0px; font-weight: bold;">III.
Fires of September by Callimachus of Cyrene</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
1</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
had a slightly somber dream last night, wherein it was the distant
future and Alexandria had fallen long ago. I lived out a quiet life
and spent my time with friends. At some point I remember trying to
free an unwilling cat.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
2</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">At
last I gathered up the courage to send my message to Ptolemaios,
praise be upon him, about the compiling of Pinakes, along with some
of my new poetry. I doubt any other pharaoh would have been—or will
ever be—as charitable as he has, though I wish he wouldn’t take
so long responding back.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
3</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Afternoon,
in the Library, young Eratosthenes was overseeing some large
construction over the observatory’s reflection pool. He told me
Ptolemaios was funding his Mesolabio. When I asked him what a
Mesolabio was, he said it was a device for “measuring the harmonic
alignments of the stars.” I’m glad Ptolemaios got back to <i>him</i>
at least.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
10</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Apollonius
was sharing his godawful Argonautica with his pitiful audience. It
mystifies me how people still in this day and age fall for cheap
Cyclic verse. Once your mediocrity gets you exiled, you shouldn’t
be allowed back, certainly not after a redraft that is barely any
better, let alone be appointed a scholar at the Library. If I had
stayed to hear another derivative epithet, I would have flung a
sandal by impulse at his stupid face.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
11</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">No
response from Ptolemaios. He is a busy man, and a great man. He is a
great and busy man. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
16</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Theocritus
invited me to a walk up the mountains. We followed a shepherd and his
herd of goats on a climb, then we sat down to rest on tree stumps.
Theocritus shared his work in progress. Delightful as always. At the
very least it was for me, since the shepherd seemed occupied, but
what do shepherds know of pastoral poetry? Theocritus is never
unwholesome to be with, never not at peace with everything. Maybe I
shouldn’t let Apollonius get to me as much as he does. And I’m
sure Ptolemaios will respond any day now. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
18</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Nothing
from Ptolemaios. Maybe tomorrow . . . Meanwhile, I’m helping Aratus
versify the Phenomena. We met up today in the observatory, below the
newly built “<span style="text-decoration: none"><i>Mesolabio</i></span>.”
To my fortune, I got to see a shooting star in the pool, though sadly
Aratus missed it. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
21</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
got very little sleep due to a nightmare. Maybe a fever dream. There
were sieges and the library was burnt down. Almost every work I had
catalogued in Pinakes was lost. Pinakes itself was completely
destroyed, as well as the Mesolabio, which had crashed down into the
reflection pool like a burning wooden bridge. I tried to enter the
library to salvage what I could, but the floor was molten and I sank
down in it.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
22</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">In
light of my dreams, I decided it best to visit the oracle. She told
me not to worry about Alexandria, but that the earlier dream about
the cat meant that I should buy a goat to spare it from sacrifice. I
might start seeing a different oracle from now on.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
23</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">To
hell with Ptolemaios! If he thinks he has more important business to
attend to, then let him. And we shall—or shan’t—see who or what
history will remember, and how. But who am I to waste time concerning
myself with that which will eventually perish? In the end, whether
Pinakes or not, all will be lost.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
24</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I am
giddy! Ptolemaios sent a messenger conveying that Pinakes was of
great significance to him, and that he had taken care of the
necessary arrangements to start the cataloguing process. He added
that he loved my new poetry and was considering promoting me to head
librarian!</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
25</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Ptolemaios
the second, great Philadelphos, peace be upon him, is dead. I am in
shambles. Ptolemaios the third has risen to the throne. How matters
will unfold from here on out remains to be seen. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
28</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Ptolemaios
the third appointed Apollonius as head librarian. I might as well
jump off the observatory with the way things are going. What’s
worse—much worse—is that Apollonius found in himself the audacity
to offer his help with Pinakes, by taking on the lead. He said it
would ease the weight of work on my shoulders so that I could devote
myself fully to “some of that <i>pretty little poetry</i>” I’m
writing. He wouldn’t know poetry if it shot him by accident in the
games. The one fate worse than this might be to have him as my
neighbor in the grave. I told him to do as he wishes with what he
wishes to do it with. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
29</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Knowing
little of what to make of all the happenings of late, I thought of
consulting with Theocritus. We walked up the mountains with the
shepherd and the goats again. He made me tea. I told him everything.
Of all the things I said, he seemed fixated on the oracle’s advice
the most. He said I should pay for a goat to be spared of sacrifice.
We went over to the herd and out of a sea of lizard gazes, one of
them was looking at me with seeing eyes, very much unlike those of a
goat. So I ended up paying the shepherd to set it free, but it
followed us back down the mountain, refusing to leave despite my
efforts to scare it off. Theocritus seemed amused by this so I asked
him if he wanted to keep it. He told me it was all mine now. I am
unsure as to what one is supposed to do with a goat, though now I can
but hope that he proves a tasteful judge of epigrams. 
</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">September
30</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
had a series of dreams last night, all involving complete strangers,
though I couldn’t discern any prophetic content this time. In one,
I was an executioner who worked at the top of a tower, suffocating
prisoners who were put into a machine. In another, I was drunkenly
sliding on a frozen lake with a girl who was my lover. And in the
final one, I was dining with another girl, this time a friend who was
angry at me. I tried inviting her to play out a sword fight with the
cucumbers we were eating. She finally gave in and we had a cucumber
fight, but I accidentally broke a glass. I was awoken by the goat
licking my face.</p>
</br>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px; font-weight: bold;">IV.
Tower of Death on the Banga Bandhu Şeyh Mucibur Rahman in 2939</p>
</br>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Summers
up the tower of death, when a heart from inside the chamber feels the
need to press the bell and ask, “Warden, how much longer of this?”
I end. And though I’ll even sometimes get the urge to say, “A
foot longer,” I never do. Alas the poor souls, at that stage, are
in no shape to take it. But helium is evil. A chamber is flushed, and
it takes with it what it may out the vent, eloping up along migrating
penguins and shooting stars. So until then, I ask of the sentenced to
close their eyes and tell me what they see. 
</p>
<p>“It’s
winter. I am sitting on a bench that overlooks the shore. I get up
and walk over to a sandwich stand. I order a sandwich and eat it as I
walk down to the beach. Sauce drips down onto snow while I’m eating
it. There is a trail of sauce following me. Warden, there is a trail!
Birds and cats are eating the ingredients that keep falling from my
sandwich. I try to finish it so it stops dripping down, but I’m
full and there’s still all of it left. Warden, what kind of a
sandwich is this? Warden, why aren’t you saying anything? Warden,
are you angry at me?”</p>
<p>At
times, it’s tempting to say it and be done. And always, just as I’m
about to, they’re out. Then contents flee, like the penguins and
the shooting stars, never to make the journey back. But then also,
not unlike the trail of sauce, we’re led to believe that something
would run out. Only up to when. A thousand years ago, they said we
were bound to, sometime. Definitely, definitely. They still say, “Any
day now.” So it’s left to me to be the one left asking, how much
is a “foot long” really? But no, I’m not angry. I swear, I’ve
never been angry.</p>
