Epstein was perhaps the most successful ritual magician of our era.
He had dedicated ritual spaces in his private properties, most
notably his island retreat, where he entertained the modern
equivalent of kings and priests—world leaders and media figures,
regardless of stated creeds—where he led his sexual ceremonies
openly in a place of power. Simply put, among the highest orders of
black magic practitioners, the total annihilation of a person,
specifically a child, is among the most potent and respectable of
acts, perhaps the only worthy goal after all others have been made
trivial. The rape of hundreds and the facilitation of these rapes,
the destruction of all normal bonds between an adult and a child, and
the establishment of a space of utter freedom for the master of the
dominion; all these things point to something worth admiring in a
spiritual sense.</p>
<p>As
perhaps the one figure in modern history with such a potent ritual
space as Little St. James, with his decades of activity, and with his
ties to the highest offices on this planet, it could only be
speculated how if he had lived for another decade, would his goal of
immortality have come closer to reality? He was the last great figure
of the Piscean Age, certainly the epitome of its unpleasant ideas,
and perhaps the greatest figure of the most important member of his
tribe (Jesus Christ, after all, was nothing less than a Pisces). It
is undoubtable that Christ had an erection as he died; Epstein’s
death, false or not, was a cession of life as absolute but liminal as
that of Christ’s. Did he leave that ‘prison’ alive or dead? It
is impossible to say. Are those who associated with him, the
foundations of the media and social world, forever tainted by him
regardless? Of course. Like a specter, he vanished into nothing,
after violations of the souls of hundreds and establishing the
loyalty of the kings of the world that make mere mass killings and
the obliteration of tribes look paltry.</p>
