<b>the magazine</b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">&amp;amp
was an amateur literary magazine that sourced its writing from /lit/
and shared it back with the same community. You could send in a
submission by email, and sometime later you’d see it done up in an
issue, which you and the 4chan equivalent of the neighbourhood kids
would read in one big release thread. You could even buy a copy
on-demand and have it shipped to your door, but mostly you’d click
through spreads of PDF pages, reading and hoping to find something
good, switching back to the thread to maybe drop the names of your
favourites or comment on the design, hoping to refresh the page and
find your own work mentioned. But whether or not anyone mentioned
yours at all, you saw your work transformed and made part of
something larger—something that felt buzzing and alive as the
thread carried on, eventually pruned and leaving you in anticipation
of the next issue, thinking <i>what should I write next time?</i>
You’d be excited by the idea of being read by, and reading the work
of, the people you’d been engaging with anonymously for years—of
making something with them that wouldn’t disappear after the
inevitable fall off the catalogue.</p>
<p>Nobody
got paid for anything that appeared in &amp;amp. There was no
rejection or acceptance—not enough submissions, in part. There was
never any explicit theme. Editing was effectively nonexistent besides
the design work, meaning you’d expect your writing to make it out
character-for-character, typos and all, on the page. And even the
design could be haphazard, often made in a scramble of days before
the release, mostly by the founding editor or sometimes by maybe two
or three trusted posters organising by email, assembling scattered
submissions into a 96-page document. Sometimes the monthly schedule
would fall apart and you’d watch the months go by, wondering when
or if there’d be another issue as your emails went unanswered (not
that you were guaranteed a reply in the first place). But still, you
looked forward to the idea of seeing another issue and of
contributing to something that seemed—amidst the ephermera of
/lit/—somehow more tangible.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">&amp;amp
wasn’t the first magazine or collaborative project to appear on
/lit/, but, like the others before it, it represented a thin slice of
the board during a particular period of time. It encompassed
incidentally the absurd, the sentimental, the obscene, pranks on the
reader, rescued pages of diaries, poems to no-one, and so on. In
being haphazard and uncurated, it gave an outlet for some of the
people loosely aligned by their browsing /lit/, giving space for a
lot of writing that probably would have otherwise died as neglected
files on aging hard drives or in descending midnight threads—unlikely
to ever be typeset or embellished or made fit for print. More than
that, some of the writing that appeared in &amp;amp stood out from
the rest, and reading each issue—beyond the communal element and
beyond the promise of having your own work read—meant a search for
those highlights.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><b>the
best-of</b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
Fourteen issues minus two photo books, 96 pages each except the slim
80 in 014: a mass of unfiltered writing across more than a thousand
pages of different authors, different formats, different fonts,
different designs and degress of legibility, between JPEG artefacts
and occasional ampersands. And scattered throughout were pieces of
writing that had been read in a blur on release day and maybe never
again, but about which someone had thought <i>this is pretty good</i>
before closing the PDF. Something like that. It seemed worthwhile (or
maybe just fun) to resurface those pieces and apply some polish while
furnishing them together in a single collection—fitting, as &amp;amp
went dark again after issue 014, that time with a greater degree of
finality.</p>
<p>
The resurfacing started in the summer of 2022 with me searching the
/lit/ archive for the old release threads and tallying every positive
mention of a piece of writing from the magazine. In threads on /lit/
I solicited recommendations for (and then later against) pieces to
include, winnowing down the pieces not just based on calibre but also
based on how they represented the sum of the magazine. Some posters
re-read issues of &amp;amp from the start to compile their favourites
while others spit out half-remembered titles of memorable pieces, and
my tally became a public list that expanded and contracted through
critiques and votes for&amp;against until it started to resemble the
table of contents you passed earlier. There were also a dedicated few
who contributed critiques of stories, design suggestions, possible
illustrations, and mock-ups of covers. But lacking any clear idea of
how I was going to bring all of that together, I decided I’d take
some time to work on things alone and figure out what needed to be
done, aiming to return in something like a few weeks to a month with
the framework for a spartan paperback. Instead, the best-of turned
into a protracted two-year+ personal project that grew and changed in
fits as I killed sporadic weekends and late nights.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
Curated, cheaper to print, a little less haphazard—those I can
guarantee. Self-contained, cohesive, competently edited, worth
reading front-to-back, worth sharing, still representative of /‍lit/,
&amp;amp, and the authors of the writing included&zwj;—those I tried
for. Having started this with no idea what I was doing, and in spite
of my lingering doubts and the many things I’d do differently a
second time, I’d like to think I’ve come far enough to do justice
to the pieces of writing herein and the ethos that relates them. A
hundred letter-sized and edited (&amp;re-edited&amp;re-edited) pages,
treated with illustrations I hoped would carry the message without
saying too much themselves, ordered in a way I hoped would at least
imply a throughline between what are in many ways disparate works,
and all of which I laid out in fragments then stuck together like a
jigsaw. And while the writing in this collection isn’t perfect,
some of it I cherish, and I do feel a tremendous fondness for the sum
of those parts and the microcosm they came out of. I hope this
collection serves as a fitting terminus for the period of time these
pieces represent, and I hope those that read it enjoy it one way or
another.</p>
