He found in the act of drinking a sliding blurring exercise in
inertia, similar to gliding in neutral down a rail-less canyon road.
It wasn’t so much the speed or delirium that was attractive to him,
moreso the unspoken possibility of careening off the edge at any
given moment—that without a thought or consideration he could find
himself floating, weightless in a two-ton tomb of metal and diesel.
Suspended in the crystalline air by some divine thread, plummeting
and silent and peaceful and dead before dying.

fist falls on the door seven times, the shape of that
shave-and-a-haircut pattern maybe almost discernible if not for the
screamsquealing of children at play, the admittedly sloppy tempo of
the knock itself, and the fact that he’s forgotten that this is a
backyard party, and that he’s been instructed to enter through the
side gate in the notes for this gig. So there he sways, eyes sliding
from doorbell to doorknob, pondering his next move. Finally, he
fumbles for his phone in his pocket. Opens the AktNow™ App (3.5
Stars on the App Store and 4 on Google Play [Notable review: “good,
but devs need to specify if the entertainment is clowns or magicians
with some sort of badge. i didnt know i ordered a clown for my nieces
birthday until he got here and when we tried to turn him away because
my niece hates clowns he started screaming and crying about how this
always happens to him and making a scene while trying to force
himself in. we threatened to call the police and then he left.
extremely uncomfortable experience” {Developer response: “Thanks
for the feedback! We’re getting right to work on implementing a
more visible method of discernment among entertainment types. We also
took the liberty of looking through your order history and found the
clown in question. We will no longer be inviting him to contract with
us.”}]). Realizing his error, he picks up his trunk and makes his
way to the sidegate. The weight of the trunk on his left side adds a
lopsided effect to his already woeful ambulatory dog paddle.</p>
<p>As
it always happens, as the sounds of the party draw nearer, so too do
the idle thoughts of suicide. It’s time to do your job, it’s time
to pull the rabbit out of the hat, it’s time to pull the gun out of
the hat, it’s time to pull the trigger, it’s time to pack up your
things, it’s time for the next party. He’s been having trouble
telling if this ideation is still some sick internal joke he plays
for himself, or if it’s becoming earnest. He stands at the gate,
unmoving. Frozen but not rigid, he deflates, and the limpness that he
feels in the pit of his gut makes its ambling way up and down his
spine.</p>
<p>It
wasn’t always like this. He got into this business because he loved
attention, loved entertaining, loved children even! And he was good
at it too, it seemed that he had a natural predisposition for sleight
of hand. At some point though, like every job, relationship, or
really any responsibility in his life, these loves wilted into
apathy, then resentment, and then ultimately overwhelming fear. His
habit of boozing grew from an aid to a necessity to the end goal of
his vocation.</p>
<p>Why
he persists, he doesn’t know. The question itself is so exhausting
that this, too, paralyses him—rendering him little more than debris
on a current impossible to navigate, much less divert (Ha!) into a
more favorable direction.</p>
<p>Flaccid,
he shoulders the gate open. The children don’t take notice of him—a
blessing—and the rest of the adults are otherwise preoccupied. He
smiles meekly at the three or four parents who note his entrance, and
they return his meekness with dips of the chin and otherwise cordial
acknowledgement. He exists, he’s here, and there’s nothing anyone
can do about it now but get on with it. He shuffles on.</p>
<p>He
gets to work unpacking his trunk in the corner of the yard, behind
the refreshments. Showtime in seven minutes.

<p style="text-indent: 0px;">The
routine itself is usually bearable, if only because it’s a routine.
In this moment everything is mechanical, every action performed is
choreographed and perfect. The robot performs to a smattering of
human bipods mounted with videocameraphones, the computer interfaces
with the computer, a perfect feedback loop increasing in pitch. Even
the children watch the performance through the lens of these handheld
realtime selfsimulacra. Stonegrinned, eyes glassy and unseeing, the
magician continues, as if he himself is also a dispassionate
observer. Rabbit. Scarves. Fire. Rings. Coin. The routine is usually
bearable, if only because it’s a routine.</p>
<p>Two
teenagers in the back, one of them vaguely resembles a past love. The
male is pantomiming and gesticulating and cruelly skanking to the
electro-swing that accompanies the act. The female
laughs with her companion and at the magician and records both
performances forever, to be uploaded to infinity, so everyone can
laugh.

<p style="text-indent: 0px;">They’re
laughing at me? Why are they laughing at me? I’m just a performer.
I’m a magician. It’s my job to entertain. I’m doing magic
tricks! Of course I look ridiculous right now, why would you mock me?
Why, why, why, why? What did I ever do to you? Is it not enough that
I’m here for your amusement, you feel compelled to humiliate me
while I’m here for your sake?</p>
<p>This
is fucking ridiculous. I can’t take this anymore. I can’t take
this anymore. I can’t take this anymore. I can’t take this
anymore. I should be laughing at all of you freaks. That’s right,
you’re the real freaks. Happy birthday to your freak son! I’m the
best magician in the county! Hate, hate, I hate you all. You could
have booked a fucking loser like Jared, and you got me instead. I’m
doing all this for you! I could have been someone huge, and I chose
to be here for the sake of you, for the sake of the party!</p>
<p>How
did I get here? Okay, I was connected by the app—I was chosen
because of some combination of proximity, pricing, and a cumulative
personal rating from other gigs in the past along with parameters
specified by the customer. None of these systems are in my control,
none of this routine is in my control. I am delivered, I am delivered
here, not by chance, not by God, but by some hateful combination of
both, conspiring to kill me. <i>To kill me!</i> To slaughter me, like
a cow in some awful cartoon machine that creates the goo for
hamburgers.</p>
<p>Jesus
Christ, she looks just like her. She’s laughing just like her.
They’re all recording this. I’m less than nothing. I’m less
than nothing. I’m nobody. I don’t have a name, I don’t have a
soul. I’m dying. I am less than a blip in an algorithm, and my
death is being livestreamed. AAAAHHHHHHHHH—</p>
