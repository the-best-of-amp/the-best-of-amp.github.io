Burgerpunk was this picture. You’ve seen it. The picture from every
burgerpunk thread, the headliner picture. 
</p>
<p>
A highway service station that’s rich to the max in traffic,
signage, burgers, parking lots—the picture shot so that its
distance comes up all flat in your face like it’s a middle-ages
painting before they’d figured out what depth was. All the signs
right in your face, all the ugly shit at once, the ugly shit without
order or perspective or priority, just filling up your eyes right
now. 
</p>
<p>
That was burgerpunk. Then we tried to write about it. 
</p>

Why would you fucking write about anything? You take this thing, this
picture, that’s just there. It’s evident. Says what you can see.
You take it. Then you try to turn your picture into lists of words
with <i>and</i>s and <i>but</i>s and much to Rodrigo’s surprise,
the Asian gas-station attendant licked the diesel off it. 
</p>
<p>
It’s not just trying to explain the picture, it’s trying to
explain exactly the thing inside the picture that’s not
explainable. That’s what literature is, right? It’s saying the
thing that you can’t say. Why is a novel that says, say, <i>orange
man bad</i>—why’s that a shit novel? Not because orange man good.
Because saying <i>This Good</i>, <i>That Bad</i> isn’t even
writing. It’s just talking onto paper. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone believed we could take burgerpunk and make it into writing.
Why believe? Because of the word. Because the word <i>burgerpunk</i>,
all alone, <i>burgerpunk</i>&zwj;—relish it—that word made us think
that words could say what can’t be said. 
</p>
<p>
So we tried to write about a picture. The picture we’d called
burgerpunk.</p>

Forget <i>we</i>. I tried to write burgerpunk. I failed:</p>
<p>
i. Burgerpunk is gritty realism.</p>
<p>
ii. Burgerpunk is a grand adventure.</p>
<p>
iii. Burgerpunk is despicable hardcore pornography.

1. In the opening of my post-DeLillo masterpiece the kid of the
single-mom who can only afford a trailer near the intersection talks
about how a driver’s license is proof of age, and kinda also the
measure of consent, depends who you ask. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
2. Working double-part-time for two different Burger Chains with
Mexican clientèle and motivational team upkeep policies she battles
with ennui and I battle to write yet another small-time story about
how nothing happens and someone’s sad about it—fuck, let’s do
sci-fi. 
</p>

1. Since Neil Stephenson already did a sci-fi thing with pizza
delivery through a high-tech net-linked suburbia, I make my one about
some surveillance state or something. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
2. There’s a company brainwashing scheme that’s a secret, and
when the hero finds out the secret he has to, like, go on the run
from the assassins dressed as mechanics or as kid-friendly mascot
characters. Kill all witnesses. Mossad’s in on it too. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
3. There’s grenades behind the counter and shotgun blasts through
ice cream truck doors. Ike E. Hummingbird, your hero, uses chip oil
to turbocharge his pickup and blast it through the corporate
headquarters’ window then he backflips out the back and does this
have shit to do with burgers anymore? Are people like us—fast-food
people, alone-at-the-interstate-rest-stop people—are we athletes,
are we killers? I make a note to rewrite the legend of Ike
Hummingbird as a film script then I get on with some serious literary
work about cumming.

<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
1. Since The World Gaping Rodeo got banned, the itinerant
All-American trucker workforce has been looking for a new, sicker
distraction. Something to radio shit-talk over. That’s where A
Double Coke With That started. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
2. The first A Double Coke With That video’s a chick whose face you
can’t see and she’s fitting fries up her cunt. At the end of the
video the john pours a double coke over the cunt full of fries and
then he starts to eat it out of her. Somehow this shit goes viral. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
3. The plot—oh fuck, the plot!—is about the grim reality of—no!
It’s about a dark conspiracy of—hold it! The book is a
description of takeout-related sex acts. In excruciating detail.
Adjectives everywhere. It’s an internet’s worth of unhappy things
you can do with a Happy Meal. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
4. After the four-hundred page first chapter on the subject of fries,
just about ready to start on the bun, I chance on a thread where the
burgerpunk picture’s right there. I look at it. Then I turn to the
open sketchbook by my side. <i>Greasy recta</i>. <i>Pickled glans</i>.
Is this it?</p>

Cyberpunk was punk, but not punk like the music. It was punk because
it ripped off detective books from the black-and-white movie days. It
was cyber plus Marlowe. The cyber Blue Dahlia. The Cybertese Falcon,
that was all. Because detectives were tough the cyber wound up
feeling punk. 
</p>
<p>
Burgerpunk probably isn’t Snow Crash or White Noise or Toni Ware or
even my pornographic magnum opus. Probably it’s a good old noir,
but stuck between truck stops and takeouts. That’s what burgerpunk
writing’s going to look like. But the second we write it down, the
second the detective’s got the baddie, then we’ll look right back
at the picture, our picture, the picture that is truly burgerpunk,
and we’ll say—<i>Nah dude, that’s not it</i>.</p>
