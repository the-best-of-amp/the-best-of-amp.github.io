<p>
Let me just start out by saying that I have several children. Only
several isn’t the right word for it. To be honest with you, I could
sit down and name them all bar one or three, but when people ask me
how many kids I have from the front of my mouth I just make up a
number. Somewhere between 15 and 25. I’ve been married a few times
and I keep accumulating stepkids along with the continuing crop I’ve
been sowing and reaping for the last 35 years. The youngest one is a
few months old and my oldest is 35 as I just mentioned, and he’s
got his own kids now—3 of them. The first time I noticed it was
somewhat disconcerting, but I feel a closer connection to my
grandkids than towards my own children. I have five of them, two with
my oldest daughter, and those kids bring me much more joy than the
five children of mine that are the same age. This revelation almost
led to a re-evaluation but I decided to just bottle it instead. For
some reason I just can’t stop having children; there was never a
plan to keep on having kids, or to have kids at all really, I just
kept on having sex, and women have a funny way of getting pregnant
before they’re menopausal, or at least that’s what my first wife
always told me. 
</p>
<p>It
all started when my first three kids were growing up, and they would
drive me crazy with their tattling, ‘John did such-and-such,’
‘Rachel broke this-or-that,’ ‘Brian spilled his juice on me,’
‘Rachel is on my side.’ On and on and on with the tattling, I
thought I would have to be admitted if it continued. At this point
the youngest kid, my 4th was barely walking and he didn’t have much
to say, and my first wife was pregnant again, so I knew it was only a
matter of time before a few more mouths joined in to claw their way
into the highest ranks of my favor. Who would have thought that a guy
like me would be so admired and adored in a way that somehow signaled
to these kids that being in trouble got you downgraded, and getting
someone else in trouble was your ticket to the top. The point is,
enough was just about getting to enough, and I just started giving a
whooping to the first kid I ran into, saving me some time and effort,
and hoping that the randomness would discourage future tattling (of
course it didn’t happen this way, that would be the result of
decision making from rational minds), but eventually I developed our
Household Justice System statute by statute until it was ready it be
put in place. 
</p>
<p>I
got the idea from some cop show we were watching on TV after dinner
one night. The maverick detective type obtained some evidence without
a warrant and the ADA chewed him out because it would be
inadmissible. Genius. The first piece of the Justice System had
propagated into our home from the broadcast tower 14 miles northwest
of our house, and the gears were turning as I planned out the
unveiling of the System. I briefed my kids on the Household Justice
System one time, and from then on the older kids would be responsible
to teach the younger kids how it works, because I would answer no
questions after I satisfied my oldest three—I even made them take
notes. When some of my kids come over for Thanksgiving or Christmas I
will overhear them schooling the youngsters on the finer points of
the System, and it makes me swell with joy. Of all the things I have
sired, the one that brings me the most pride is the one that only
took a week to gestate. I tell myself it’s because my pride, joy,
love, happiness, interest, enthusiasm, is split up equally between my
two dozen or so children—that’s why I love my grandchildren so
much too I guess. I have no idea if this is true or reasonable but
being someone that wouldn’t have to rationalize something like this
is not who I aspire to be. At this point, I would say about 50% of
the System is addendum created by the kids as it passed on through
generations, but the crux and the purpose remain. The crux of the
System arrived courtesy of the broadcast tower, and other than the
rule about my answering questions (which is the main reason the
System has changed so much over the years), the crux of the System is
what kept all these damn kids from getting me a vasectomy, which is
as follows, quoted from the notebook of my oldest son who recently
found and showed me it last Thanksgiving:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;"><b>Household
Justice System §1.1</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;">Any
evidence of wrongdoing, misbehaving, acting up, misconduct,
rough-housing, mischief, indecorum, misconduct, &amp;c. is made null
and void by any tattling, snitching, ratting out, squealing,
blabbing, &amp;c. and is inadmissible as evidence of said wrongdoing,
misbehaving, acting up, misconduct, rough-housing, mischief,
indecorum, misconduct, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;"><b>Household
Justice System §1.2</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;"><i>Perpetrator</i>
being defined as someone who is guilty of wrongdoing, misbehaving,
acting up, misconduct, rough-housing, mischief, indecorum,
misconduct, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;"><i>Tattler</i>
being defined as someone who is guilty of tattling, snitching,
ratting out, squealing, blabbing, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;"><i>Residing
Judicial Authority</i> being defined as Dad. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;"><b>Household
Justice System §1.3</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; text-indent: 0px;">Any
perpetrator who is brought to the attention of the residing judicial
authority by a tattler is ineligible to be sentenced to punishment
for those acts the perpetrator committed. Any tattler who brings
evidence of a perpetrator to the residing judicial authority will be
sentenced to equal punishment as deserving of the acts committed by
the perpetrator. Any perpetrator who is discovered by the residing
judicial authority will be sentenced to equal punishment as deserving
of the acts committed by the perpetrator. Any perpetrator who brings
him/herself to the residing judicial authority will be sentenced to
equal or lesser punishment as deserving of the acts committed by the
perpetrator. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">There
was more to it of course, but the crux of the System has almost been
around for 30 years, and I have had no problems with it yet. At the
start there was a liminal period where the kids were transitioning
over to this new concept. It took them a while to figure out that I
was no longer on their individual sides anymore, that it was them
united against me. Every new kid has a probationary period ending
about six months after they’re 4 years old, but other than that, I
have been living in a tattle-free household for much longer than a
tattle-full household and it’s beautiful. 
</p>
<p>The
question I always get when I tell people about my system is what
about the serious stuff? To that I always reply: what about it? I
worked hard to make my system a fair and universal catch-all. I know
a lot of parents whose rule is ‘no tattling unless you are asked
to,’ but I find that unnecessarily oppressive. As a grown adult I
already have a huge advantage over these kids, so I figure I might as
well play by the rules as well and give them a fighting chance.
Honestly, the System makes the serious stuff much easier to deal
with, because my kids are used to coming to me with stuff they did
wrong, and we can discuss it in a much better setting than if they
got ratted out by their siblings or if I discovered it on my own. I
want to make it clear that this System was not entirely enacted for
my own convenience; it was enacted to teach my kids to own their
mistakes, and to leave other people’s mistakes alone. Notice in
§1.3 that if the perpetrator brings their crime to me before I find
out, they have the chance for equal or lesser punishment, and they
always got lesser punishment. For the majority of the time, they got
no punishment at all, but if I found out they did something wrong,
and in 24 hours they hadn’t come to me and admitted it, I struck
down on them hard and fast. I don’t relish the chance to punish my
children, but I take it seriously, and I get creative with it.
Letting others alone was the other big purpose of my System but that
is something that has slowly morphed over the years. 
</p>
<p>When
I envisioned it in my head, the secondary purpose of the System would
play out by having the other kids all but ignore their sibling’s
mistakes—other than what they did to torment each other—but
nowadays the kids put a huge amount of pressure on each other to turn
themselves in. I rarely use group punishment either, so the fact that
the others are so committed to the system surprised me at first, but
I slowly realized that what they were doing accomplished the same
objective as tattling to me: they don’t want someone else to avoid
punishment when they were unable to do so. It’s such a childish way
to respond but I’ve found that adults act this way much more than
is appropriate, which I have come to realize is not a learned
behavior but something innate within us that needs to be crushed, and
I think my kids are in the best position to do so. 
</p>
<p>Back
last Thanksgiving, when John showed me the original 26-year-old notes
he took from my first and only briefing of the System, I got a big
old blackboard from the city college downtown and had the kids that
live with me write down that first section of the System on it. At
Christmas I had all the kids work together and pool their total
knowledge of the system onto the blackboard. I was amazed to see all
of the extra detail that had been created over the years, but I
wasn’t all that surprised by it. By this point I have a few go-to
punishments for the younger kids, but if I don’t waive punishment
for an older kid, I have them tell me what my options are depending
on what they did. I have almost become redundant within the System
that I created, but more shocking than that, I discovered that it
didn’t bother me at all—in fact I was proud of my children for
learning to be so self-sufficient. 
</p>
<p>John
had a talk with me a few years ago, Rachel too a little later on,
about how he wasn’t going to use the Household Justice System in
his house. He came to me like he was a perpetrator, and I waived his
punishment, same thing with Rachel. I was taken aback by this because
my parents didn’t do anything much like I did, and I never expected
my kids to think they had to do things like I do. I guess it’s
different because I have some kids that are younger than my
grandchildren, but I was still a little flattered that my System made
such an impact on them, that they felt the need to discuss their
parenting style with me. I tried to tell my current wife about this
but she just went on and on about how John was crazy not to use the
System and it worked so well and all this, but first of all she
didn’t grow up in the first 10 years of the System, it took me
weeks to try and explain it to her before I just gave up and had the
kids do it, and I think she may actually be a little younger than
John is. Now that I think about it I’m really not sure, I was
really young when I had John—I don’t know his birthday but I do
know the year. As for my current wife I could guess right in five
tries, so that puts her right on either side of my son. Either way,
the point in fact being that her opinion on the matter isn’t super
important to me. Well the grandkids would tattle on the kids for a
while—John didn’t know what to do about it and I sure as hell
didn’t either. Rachel’s weren’t quite old enough for this
problem at the time, but it was in the back of my mind while we were
dealing with the problem, and wouldn’t you know it, it made me do
something that I hadn’t done in 25 years: I amended the system.</p>
