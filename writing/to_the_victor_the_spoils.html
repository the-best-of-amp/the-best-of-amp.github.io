<i>It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine
the end of capitalism.</i></p>
<p>	—
Fredric Jameson</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Criminal
Executioner Overlord Nefarious Norgath grasped his battle scepter and
entered the Market Arena. Clad in brightly-colored armor festooned
with the skulls of past mergers and proudly bearing the shiny logo of
his corpo-tribe, Overlord Norgath cut an imposing figure indeed. To
his right screamed and cheered his corpo-thralls. At the far end of
the arena another supercharged, burly man-beast made an entrance,
clutching an electrified trident in one hand and a vicious blade in
the other. In equal and opposite reaction, the thralls of his
corpo-tribe cheered for their champion. Through armor and helmet, the
two contestants sneered at each other menacingly, snorting like
bulls, steam spouting from the vents in their face plates in sharp
bursts after their powerful lungs greedily sucked in air.</p>
<p>“Silence!
Quiet you all!” bellowed an immensely obese man who sat atop a
lavish, bejewelled tower overlooking the rabid masses.</p>
<p>“I,
Overseer Morbidius Flattus Maximus, come to you today to preside over
and officiate the sacred corpo-rite of merger and acquisition by
combat!” At this guttural announcement the gathered horde once more
went overboard in their love for violence and profit, stomping their
feet and chanting deafening cries in brutal ecstasy. In the higher
bleachers of the stadium, the mutants and cursed ones of the menial
classes could no longer contain their bloodlust and in their
excitement began fighting each other, ripping and clawing and sending
the occasional limb flying until finally the pit guards patrolling
the stands beat them back into submission. In the lower stands,
nearer to the action, the middle management thralls, clad in
respectable business robes, clapped and placed bets. And lastly in
the VIP turrets surrounded by armed guards, machine-gun nests, barbed
wire, and flood lights, the patrician C-suite Overlords smiled thinly
and whispered discreetly among themselves, sure of their plots, their
investments long ago tied down and secured.</p>
<p>“Yes,
make no mistake,” Overseer Maximus continued. “The long-standing
feud between Fallmart Inc. and Crosshair Ltd. is to be settled once
and for all this auspicious day, in a glorious gladiatorial fight to
the death! And to the survivor goes the legal right of all the
forfeited assets, obligations, and contracts herewith detailed . . .”
Overseer Maximus proceeded to read a long list of legal stipulations
from a scroll, the holdovers of the sacred code of the lost times of
the Corporate Golden Age before the Great Crash. Above, the menials
nodded off and fidgeted and grew restless, while the pit guards,
watching them intently from the aisles, gripped their stun clubs in
anticipation of any trouble.</p>
<p>“Now,
without tarrying a moment further,” Overseer Maximus went on, his
voice booming theatrically and his hands gesticulating with a
histrionic flourish. “Ladies and gentle-mutants, slaves, menials,
and part-time employees; overlords and captains of industry, by the
powers vested in me by the all-knowing, all-wise Invisible Hand, may
the Market decide your fates! Begin!”</p>
<p>At
this word the two titanic warriors lurched forward and met in a
brutal clash of muscle and steel. Executioner Overlord Norgath swung
his battle scepter with immense force, while his opponent Krull,
effortlessly bobbing between the cruel mace-swings, stabbed with his
shock-trident and slashed with his cost-cutter blade. Norgath,
despite his hulking size, gracefully dodged these swift attacks until
at last Krull’s relentless onslaught paid off and he scored a
glancing hit with his cost-cutter and slit Norgath’s bicep.</p>
<p>With
first blood spilt, a gleeful uproar issued from the crowd. Boosted by
combat stims and with his faith in the Invisible Hand and its divine
Profit Motive steady, Norgath felt no pain and showed no reaction.
His bloodshot, pitiless eyes remained fixed on his quarry.</p>
<p>Krull
cackled mean-spiritedly, his wicked laughter tinny and muted behind
the thick steel trap of his armored face plate. “Fallmart will be
mine, weakling! The Market demands it! The Invisible Hand wills it!”</p>
<p>Norgath
scoffed wordlessly. This fool will be crushed ‘neath his mace in
short order. No use talking to a dead man. Krull thrusted with his
trident but Norgath sidestepped it and, with a sweeping upward
diagonal swing of his scepter knocked it aside. The shock trident
went spinning many yards through the air until it found its way
plunged into the chest of an unfortunate middle manager seated in the
forth row, who soon burst into flames from the excessive voltage.
Those in the crowd variously gasped, laughed, and cheered. 
</p>
<p>Looking
down from upon his luxurious perch above, Overseer Maximus gloated
over the carnage. He feasted upon wasteland boar and gulped down
potent rad-booze as he savored the barbarous spectacle. 
</p>
<p>With
now only his trusty cost-cutter, Krull tossed it between his hands
playfully as if ready to fake out his foe with his guiltless wiles.
Then without warning he unleashed a frenzied storm of slashes,
putting everything he had into it to overwhelm his hated nemesis and
spray his blood over the sand so that he may deliver value to his
shareholders. Norgath moved back with uncanny, juiced-up agility,
bypassing each wild cut, until finally the fiend attacking him became
exhausted and gave him an opening. In one momentous, low sweep of his
weapon, he smashed in Krull’s leg at the knee. Screaming in pain
the wounded tyrant fell down on his good knee. The massive trunk of
his broken leg now lay limp and shattered on the ground. Despite
being maimed, Krull kept viciously waving his cost-cutter in
defiance, rage-filled and indomitable to the last. Norgath extended
his battle scepter out with one hand, with the flamboyant flair and
august bearing of a Caesar, then wheeled around to survey the
audience . 
</p>
<p>“What
does the market demand?” he thundered, his shout loud enough to
overwhelm the collective noise of the entire stadium.</p>
<p>“Death!
Death! Death!” shrieked and pleaded the eager spectators.</p>
<p>After
some struggle Overseer Maximus heaved himself up off his haunches and
stood wobbling, balancing his immensity effortfully on his
overburdened legs. With a greasy smile he raised his corpulent arm
and fatalistically cast his thumb down.</p>
<p>“So
judges the almighty Invisible Hand. Its divine will made briefly
manifest by its unworthy earthly representative,” he pronounced
with trembling mystic reverence.</p>
<p>With
the matter thus decided Norgath aimed his mace at Krull’s head and
wound it up back and forth slowly to toy with this upstart challenger
as if preparing to casually hit a home run off a batting tee. His now
utterly spent adversary spat on the ground in resignation and leered
at his better with unfathomable disdain. 
</p>
<p>In
one bone-crunching arc of his mace, the Magnate of Murder, the Tycoon
of Torture, the great and fearsome warlord of commerce, Nefarious
Norgath, scored a rib-shattering blow square onto Krull’s chest,
catapulting his broken body several feet where he then landed with a
heavy thud and settled lifeless in a crumpled, vanquished heap.
Norgath raised his battle scepter in ultimate triumph and the arena
exploded.</p>
<p>On
the jumbo screens above the stands, Fallmart Inc.’s stock price
shot up in magnificent winning green while Crosshair Ltd.’s stock
bled out in abject defeated red.</p>
