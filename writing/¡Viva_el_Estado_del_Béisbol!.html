It was the bottom of the seventh when it all started. I was sitting
in the stands, right behind the catcher. I had a historic view,
though I didn’t know it at the time. Our Venezuelan stadium was
spilling with emotional fans, half were shirtless, all were on their
feet. None were quiet. Being the closest to the players, I and those
around me had an obligation to our country and to our team to be the
most fanatic group in the stadium. Virulent swears were cast, and
many personal attacks on family, sexuality, and physical prowess were
made in detail towards the batters. I often wonder how much my words
tipped fate that night. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
Caracas Bulls had been collectively slumping all game, the big city
team was getting demolished by the much less renowned, and by all
metrics worse, Barinas Reds. The score was debatably twenty-to-one,
but scorekeepers would later relay conflicting accounts due to events
that were about to take place. The Bulls’ home crowd was ready to
explode and were given the opportunity to do so. With the Bulls’
star catcher Eriko Santana up at the plate, the pitcher, whose name
was also lost in the myth of the moment, beaned Eriko in the ribs
with a ninety-five-mile-per-hour fastball, and clearly meant to. Next
was a moment of great factual debate, but let me tell you gringos, I
saw it all with my own two eyes, honest to God and my mother. Here is
what happened:</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Eriko,
recovering from the pain of the pitch, threw his eyes at the pitcher
who was playing coy on the mound. Bat still in his hands, a great
sprint ensued, the fastest I’d ever seen the old catcher run, and
on that mound he beat the poor pitcher to death. On a normal day,
fights like this were ended before any major injuries, it was all
show, but this wasn’t a normal day. Instead of players and umpires
rushing in and pulling the fighters apart, we, the fans, cut the net!
I rushed in myself, rabid with loyalty for my team and alongside
thousands of others. Together we helped beat and kick the poor
pitcher and then the whole rotten team until there was no more to
beat or to kick. We won the game.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Once
the unfortunate athletes were properly dead, our fanaticism grew into
something greater. Eriko was lifted up above our heads and placed on
a ripped-out chair from the stands. We strode with him as our king,
his bat in hand, pointing us onwards. We broke out of the stadium,
our numbers only increasing, and paraded through the streets of the
city. The umpires, apparently held complicit in the score, were hung
along the road from the street lamps. The same fate was met by any
Reds fan unfortunate enough to attend the game. Eriko took well to
his new position on top of us and showered us with passionate
outcries on baseball and life. “The Bulls are loose!” he repeated
again and again with his great moustached smile that often burst with
laughter, “Ándale! The Bulls are loose!” I marched behind and
felt an utter sense of loyalty. I screamed at the hung fans as if
they were alive, just so they knew I hated them. I threw rocks and
bricks through windows just because I could. I’m not ashamed of
these actions mis amigos, it was in the heat of the moment, but what
came next I relay to you in great shame.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
direct area around the stadium was rapidly seized in the name of
Eriko, not by his command, but rather as an act of coronation from
the fans. Eriko, the great Bull, sat on top of the city’s finance
center, a building chosen for its height, and he broadcast his
message on as many radio and television stations as the fans could
acquire for him. “There are more bullfighters left than just those
dirty Reds! The Bulls will never be fully free until ALL the
bullfighters are dead!” His admonishments were not specific, but,
Lord save me, they gave a fated path to follow. House to house,
apartment to apartment we knocked, entered, questioned, and killed.
Loyalty to the team had to be absolute, despite the fact that I had
heckled my own team only hours before! Please, as I tell you, do not
forgive me, there is no forgiveness for the killings of families, of
women, of children (O Cristo!). I only tell you now because you must
know exactly what happened and have faith in the truthfulness of our
correspondence so we can all return to peace once more.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
city was purged in a mere two days, and Eriko, from this point
forward, whether he liked it or not, became a revolutionary. As he
spoke over the airways his myth became vast and noble, and his
following flourished. “I speak softly but I carry a big bat!” was
his slogan—entirely unoriginal, but nobody cared, we all wanted to
win what he started. Nobody, even today, knows the politics behind
the revolution, if there are any they are kept secret somewhere
inside Eriko’s mind, however, our fervor at the time was beyond
reconciliation or any type of peaceful resolution. We were ready to
die, but we didn’t even know what for!</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In
just another fated event, word got around that the members of the
Venezuelan national assembly were present in the capitol building at
the time of the game, and, to the horror of the CIA—<i>I kid! Ay!
Don’t give me that look!</i>—to the horror of everyone, the
building was surrounded and assailed by thousands of fans, protected
only by a small loyal militia. Government troops were called in from
the outside of the city, but it was a hopeless effort. After three
days the building was finally stormed and all members of the national
assembly that did not commit suicide were brought to the roof of the
finance center to be judged. Eriko himself had assembled a small
cabinet of officials consisting of teammates and influential fans who
were ready to shape their companies (and thus our country) to his
will. At this point I had cast off my extremism and was at the church
most of my time. I prayed for forgiveness while others prayed for
their team to win. Nevertheless, I could not escape what I had helped
create.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
Sunday after the game, which had taken place only six days before,
Eriko officially took national power. Fans called it “bobblehead
night,” though there was no baseball game, nothing of the sort.
With the national committee corralled up on the roof and surrounded
by fans, myself among them, a trial was held for each politician. The
Bull’s ace pitcher stood sixty feet away, while Eriko personally,
with his burly moustache and small chubby frame, walked up to each of
the prosecuted and asked him a simple question: “What is the goal?”
The politicians were stumped, and I must say, so was I. They murmured
in tears, they screamed hate in protest, and some stood somberly in
silence. All however were beaned. With God as my witness, I profess
to you, every pitch I saw the pitcher throw landed right between the
eyes! Never in any game had I seen him so accurate! After the
ceremonial beaning, which often knocked out the receiver (and hence
“bobblehead night”), the crowd was let loose, and the persecuted
were judged harshly. Each criminal was thrown off the building as a
form of execution.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At
sunset, when the old president was finally beaned and thrown to his
death, Eriko walked to the edge of the building and looking down
remarked: “The answer, my fans, is none of what you have just
heard.” The crowd now was intently silent, partially for the dead
we now saw, sprawled on the street below, and partially because
Eriko’s voice enraptured us. “Our goal is not in nationalization,
not in reform, we want nothing to do with the obvious corruption of
this once great country. Our goal, my fans—” he paused, “no, <i>my
friends</i>. Our goal, my friends, is to WIN THE WORLD SERIES!”
Everyone went wild, I confess, even myself. We sang and danced and
watched as beautiful explosions of color shot out from the nearby
stadium and into the sky.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So
you see commissioner and Mr. President, this is not just an insurgent
force looking for war, in fact, we want nothing of the sort. Eriko
and his government have sent me here today for very simple
negotiations that I think you will find more than reasonable. We do
not want additional land, nor resources, nor even continued
leadership of Venezuela. We do not want any of those things on two
conditions: Firstly, you and your forces, Mr. President, must
de-escalate military tensions with our country, tensions that will no
doubt cause massive amounts of death in our state and of your people,
more than, I am afraid to say, has already occurred at our hands.
Secondly, commissioner, we look to you as the leading authority in
the world of baseball. You, knowing what you have seen our team do,
must allow the Caracas Bulls a chance to compete on the biggest stage
of all: the World Series. Men, once these demands are met, I am happy
to tell you that we—Eriko, I, and our government—will be more
than pleased to initiate a peaceful transition of power to
authorities from your country. Make these demands happen and I
believe that all of our sides can achieve great good. This all rests
in your hands, caballeros. There will always be another matador, but,
at the same time, it is only right to spare the honorable bull. I
trust you both will make the right decision.</p>
