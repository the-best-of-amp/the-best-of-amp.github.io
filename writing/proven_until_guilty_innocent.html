Tell you what, tell you this: I used to go to karate, back when I was
six or so. And at karate, something took place, which I haven’t
told anyone, but which I now feel the need to come out about and
tell. Here’s it: It’s a kid who whipped another kid with his
karate belt (White. Most weren’t ever anything beyond. Neither was
I.) after the sensei had gone and no adults were left in the dojo. But
in the dojo were me, the whipper, the whipped, and another kid
standing next to the kid who got whipped. Now he, (the kid standing
next to the one that got whipped) is important. He’s what makes it
all come together. Though maybe I make it come together too in a way.
Hopefully I at least also make it come together or else what’s the
point in telling you? And maybe it’s you too who makes it come
conclusiv—anyhow—So the whipper was in one corner, the others
were in another with their backs turned to the whipper, and I was at
watching distance from all. Then the whipper rolled up his belt into
a spiral and raised up his arm and the belt went “F-CHSHHHH!” all
the way over to the other side of the dojo onto the victim’s back.
He screamed and he turned around and he saw the whipper standing far
away in his corner (too far to have had anything to do with the
crime) and he saw the kid standing right next to him (too close to
not have been the perpetrator) and so, clueless as to the whipping,
he thought he (the one he was next to) must have slapped him on the
back and then quickly transitioned into looking all clueless. So
then, misdirecting his revenge in blind rage, he punched this
innocent kid in the gut and ran out wailing. Then the whipper ran
out, snickering to himself as if he had planned to get away with it
from the start, and as if the only reason he succeeded in doing so
wasn’t the pure chance of them not turning their backs. Then I was
left in the empty dojo with the innocent one, who was on the floor,
grunting in pain from the punch. And in that moment, I felt at
once—for the first time ever—a spooky sense of singularity with
my fellow man (my sweaty, smelly, grunting in pain, fellow man)
through getting to witness what he ended up with, just by standing
there and minding his own. Though now I wish the whole affair had
made me feel spooky singular with a cute girl instead; sweaty,
smelly, grunting and all.</p>
