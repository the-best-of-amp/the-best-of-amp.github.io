It’s like a bog down here man, I’m sickof&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;allthisscum
and wet sand. It’s gotta lot of smells that’ll makeaman up and
leave. Ya see like under this house that is, like, under the boards
and the basement, Ijust be diggin man. At first it was nice, what
with the family gone I could be diggin all day. And man, like my
hands were cramping on that there pick handle. But since see I got
that family bein here more and they got the heat on and it gets real
dank. Realreal dank. But I don’t mind that much, amansgotta deal
with suchandthelike. It’s the activity up there that really gets me
prayin. Can’t be pickin away and such when mawandpaw lounge in the
basement, or them kids be racin and foolin around. Like so I’m just
sittin here next to this puddle man, prolly not good for me and,
yaknow, chemicalwiseandsuch. Shouldnt breathe too hard round . . .
Anyway, like I’m saying, the family always is in the basement, and
aman best not dig where he’s heard. 
</p>
<p>You
see, last lil tunnel I was workin me on was back up in Monticello.
You don’t know where that is, but anyway, I be diggin when the
foreman of this, oh yea I’m diggin under this steel mill right? so
this foreman here found my little hidey hatch, where I dun started
carvin paths, and this foreman he tell me I’ve goneand
trespassedonprivatepropertyorsumthin. I didn’t know it counted when
you went that deep, so I gotup and got my ass outta there. He was
gettin to pointificaytin on some lawyer talk and the like and I
didn’t plan to stick around and balk my way into some money
trouble. 
</p>
<p>Yea
so, here is pretty nice allthingsconsidered. I mean aside from the
bogginess. You prolly like that, but I tellya I don’t. No sir ree.
I mean to tell ye last night, well, ok, so you see that sheet over
there, on that little ledge I mined out? So that’s were I’ve been
sleepin right, now it and I was having some crazy dreams, practice-ly
a snorin out my britches, and I wake up and my own sweat, shit you
not, drippin back downonme! It had gone and condensated up and then
rained right back down. So you see I wake coughin and wheezin in my
own sweat and you know my minds tellin me: sir, yougottagetouttahere.
But you see it ain’t no choice of my own right, so you know like
how we got this urge to blink ya can’t fight, after a while? So I
get up on my feet, and I’m near the entrance and my mind is sayin
“YOU NEED AIR! AIR! AIR!” so I ain’t not gonna comply, and to
my own begrudgingment I pop up into the basement and why, I tellya,
it’s like heaven’s own cuppa water right down my lungs. Never
have I ever gone and taken a better breathe in my life sohelpme and
then some. 
</p>
<p>But
you see the problem is that one of them little boys was sleeping,
and, ok well I ain’t told nobody this but you right? so keep shush
about it, no peepin. So the boy was on this here otto man, and his
peanut-head and teeny hands be stickin out from a big ole blanket of
his. But you see, the thing is, he was sleepin with his eyes open!
Now, I know what you gon tell me, you gon say, well, that there boy
was awake as the day, but listen Ilivetatellya that I sat there all
exhasperated for a good half an hour and that boy didn’t much move
a inch. NotaninchItellyou. Not an inch at all. So I get up and crawl
back down here like nothin ever happen, and really it ain’t. Just
been keepin my own all this time since. 
</p>
<p>Did
I show you what Ibeen diggin? Here let me pickya up. Okay ya see that
I’ve got three pair-lel pathageways down this side, and what I did,
I mean, what had happened was that I dug one right? And then I hit
water, a whole little hollow pool of it cracked in. I think I could
go down and swim if I wanted to. But anyway, I can’t go much
further, I mean I can’t pick no water right? So I start diggin a
second, and well, I ain’t ivy league particularly so when I dig it
pair-a-lel to the first to my dee-light it just end right up in the
water again. Yep. Right up in it. So that’s why the last one fit so
far down there, cause I sure as shit didn’t plan to risk pickin
water again. Okay, let me get my galoshes and we’ll walk down it
andillshowyuaround. 
</p>
<p>They
just boots I got from that there previously mentioned steel mill, but
still, I call em galoshes since I been using them to keep the water
out. So you see there sum water on the ground here, but I ain’t
pick no water this third time. Ibeen, okay look, see I’m buildin up
church down this here passageway. Now before you say it, I know it
ain’t as holy as the real thing, no sir ree, no way. But I reckon
it’ll have a couple holes if the big man let me. So see how I
architiculated it? You can’t much build up with holes and shit, so
I make the whole thing opposite way round. I been praying that god
ain’t have no problem with the extremeties of my design. So look we
got the seats inarow here, if ya please. I always did like the old
long benches they got up in them cathedrals, but like see, they’re
dug in the ground now, well I guess we already in the ground . . .
what would you call it . . . well anyway, so they’re kind of like
trenches. And I been saying to god I’m very sorry bout the
trenches, on account of their being in the war, it ain’t got no
place seen in the sanctification of the church. For I don’t got
much choice in the matter, I makedo with what Igot. The pulpit up
here go real lowdown and what not. I spent a good day scoopin mud out
that hole there before, well before water started springin up out it!
So I try an take it like ole Moses did, but it ain’t exactly the
same, on account of it actually bein an inpeedament instead of a
blessin and shit. 
</p>
<p>I
tell you if one thing worked out all right though it’s the choir,
boy. So look, I dun dig them steps going down and down, and at the
bottom sure enuff the water come pouring bout. So I said to myself
“Heck with this, I ain’t got no right buildin a holy place outta
holes,” and I went back and slept, and I was tossin and turning and
I was angry asallgetout. The next morn I wake up and dress myself for
another day of diggin, and as I’m walkin down passageway number
three I hear a great commotion, and I get closer and I’m telling
myself “Great god almighty the choir singin!” and sure enuff I
walk on in and the biggest toads you ever did see were croakin and a
yellin in the puddle right on down them steps! Man if my old ass
wasn’t dancin that day and hoopin and hollerin along with them.
They been awful quiet since, just resting I guess. 
</p>
<p>Anyway,
you prolly heard enuff of me and my pointificayshun, best we start
the sermon I say. Gather you got your notes prepared? That’s good,
Imma just place you on down in the water now, the pulpit ain’t as
scary as the real one cause they ain’t all lookin up at ye high and
mighty, so don’t worry none bout givin a big speech. Yes, now just
wait a minute while I go sit down, then thee floor is yours mister.
