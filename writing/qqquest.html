It was a real hotdog of a Wednesday. You couldn’t throw a stone
without hitting a smiling face. The pharmacist is handing out water
balloons and there’s so much laughter going around you could make a
hammock out of it. The Shriners are in the river, right down to their
skivvies. The local law enforcement is having an arm wrestling match
with the bowling team, loser buys hamburgers for the winner. Every
cat &amp; dog &amp; hamster in town gets a taste of popsicle today.
The red wagons are racing down the hill and the doughboys are raising
up the flag. It’s the kind of sunshine that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
</p>
<p>“Harvey,
you’ve got no movementum! Your zi-fi is going neglar” the
Valinora twins say in unison. Harvey pays no mind to their attempt to
interrupt the world. There are lollipops to lick and free hula-hoops
at the General Store. 
</p>
<p>The
Valinora twins and Harvey’s mother and his teacher and his
development engineer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they all live in space. They live on a
colossal titanium cylinder that hurdles through the cosmos. They have
concerns like relativity tremors, continuum meltdowns and many other
abhorrent fatal conditions. There are many types of jobs on the
cylinder; Harvey’s father is a quantum deconstructionalist. He
records and studies the formation of concave electrons in four
dimensions. Millions of lives rely on his work. So Harvey Fenton
found a world. It is a far better place. 
</p>
<p>The
prom king &amp; queen show up at the car wash on the shoulders of the
football team, nickel in hand and grinning from ear to ear. You can
hear good time rock ’n’ roll on every radio dial in town, from
the courthouse all the way to the kids dancing in the park. Old
friends who saw each other yesterday are meeting on the sidewalk
saying, “It’s like I haven’t seen you in a month full of
Sundays! How’s life you old so &amp; so?” 
</p>
<p>Down
at the malt shop there’s a crowd of teens playing hop scotch on
pogo-sticks while ol’ Denny puts a fresh soda pop in every hand.
It’s enough to tickle you pink. All of a sudden, you can hear a
voice through a megaphone, coming from the middle of town. Everyone
is trying to hear it, the voice sounds so proud and excited. People
start making their way towards it and soon they find that the Mayor
is making a big flap in town square. One look and you can tell he’s
pulling out all the stops. “We’ll have the whole country turning
their heads” he says. “Right here in our little town, we are
going to change the face of things. They’ll have to grind up boots
to make enough ink for all the newspapers they’re going to print,
and we’ll be on the front page of every one of them! So everybody
mark your calendars with a big red circle on next week’s State
Fair. Make sure the whole family is there, we don’t want anybody to
miss it. Hold all your questions, we want it to be a surprise and
yes, little Timmy, your goldfish can come too!” Applause ensued,
games of marbles resumed and before you knew it, news of the big day
filled up the town like a tall glass of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
</p>
<p>“The
council recognizes Alfred Fenton. The floor is yours Dr. Fenton.”</p>
<p>“Ahem.
Dignitaries of the Living Tribunal, Masters from the Academy of
Measure, Brothers of New Pluto, Shogun of Seventh Tokyo, fellow men
and women of Zenith 1; I bid you all warm welcome to this assembly.
These are auspicious times we live in. The constant threat of a
hyper-speed collision with inverted atoms has been abated due to a
noble sacrifice by the Centurian Congress to abstain from the use of
corrupted neon densities as fuel.</p>
<p>“Those
who call Zenith 1 home, allow me to congratulate you on successfully
splicing the human genome with a neutrino, forming what we’re
calling a photon-sapien.</p>
<p>“For
five hundred years, the force or being known as ARC-10 has left a
nuclear graveyard in its wake; trillions have been neglared.
Incredibly, the Celestials have discovered a method by which entire
galaxies can be suspended in a geodesic net, allowing their polarity
to be augmented to the point of Pandrolenthal Cohesion. It has
neutralized ARC-10 in every encounter thus far. 
</p>
<p>“Despite
unpredictable, lethal variables arising from each hour of each day,
survival has become an archaic notion. Neo-science has rendered time
inconsequential, yet death remains inescapable. The inevitability of
death is bested only by the inevitability of creation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which is
why I stand before you now. 
</p>
<p>“As
part of my work with concave electrons, atoms are ‘flattened’ in
order to ‘stretch’ them laterally. This reveals the atom’s
composition on a heleoscopic level. While an atom was in this state,
I took the liberty to bombard it with mutated uranium particles. The
result was a five spectrum transparency, rather than the previously
established limit of four spectrums. I was incredulous. A discovery
of this magnitude required sophisticated data to corroborate it.
Immediately I began conducting an array of examinations. Upon running
an electrical cryogenics scan, I was rewarded with the detection of
sub-heleoscopic matter. 
</p>
<p>“I
was alarmed at first. If my observations prove correct, they negate
the principles on which neo-science is founded. I resolved to
advance. Within a week, I was able to isolate the anomalies and thus
able to complete a preliminary analysis of the anomaly’s
properties. One characteristic in particular is remarkable: They emit
a signal. A nano-frequency. The most infinitesimal pulse of
information imaginable. Furthermore, they are all saying the same
thing: X marks the spot.</p>
<p>“When
filtered through a gamma compressor, one can observe a rudimentary
numerical system within the signal. I superimposed the data on an
interstellar map and followed the coordinates to a region of the
universe previously thought to contain nothing but asteroid debris,
millions of light-years from any formed cosmic bodies. 
</p>
<p>“Directions
to one location in space are imprinted on every atom in the universe.
My son and I depart tonight, to what could be the site of the Big
Bang&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“Step
right up! Don’t be shy, come on up here to make your friends hush
and your girl blush! For heaven’s sake, show us your muscle
milkshake! Win a prize for your doll and to your doll you’ll be a
prize! Single file now folks, everybody gets a turn!” The carnies
are in fine form, all down the midway, using every trick in the book
to get a crowd. Speaking of tricks, the magician is looking grand,
turning rabbits into cards, doing card tricks with no hands. A
person’s senses can get tied up in a big gorgeous knot trying to
take it all in at once: you can hear all manner of bells and
whistles, whirling joy and garrulousness; the aroma of cotton candy,
grass and canvas tent filling your nostrils; the night sky lit up
with poppers, spanglers, bifflers and spazzlers. 
</p>
<p>Suddenly,
beaming bright and strong through all the whimsy, is a spotlight on
center stage. The outline of a small sphere, resting on the top of a
four-legged table, is made visible by a white sheet. The flashing
bulbs of the State Fair go dim and the music fades away. The Mayor
strides up the stairs and onto the stage. He wears an expression of
superlative wisdom as he waits for all eyes and ears to follow the
spotlight. Finally, he begins. “Ladies and gentleman! Children of
all ages! Tonight, we take our place among the stars&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“This
is the final transmission from Dr. Alfred Fenton, aboard the
Ulysses_7. At our current speed of twenty light years per
millisecond, we will reach our destination in minutes. There are
mental and physical phenomenons occurring. I am witnessing scar
tissue on my forearm reverting into unmarred skin. The ship’s
controls are reacting to my thoughts. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can remember&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
being born&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“Folks
there is something special about this town. I know you all feel it.
There is something here worth remembering&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“Everything
is becoming translucent, as if all is evaporating. There is no doubt
that we are not coming back from where we are going. Yet we are not
afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“
. . . what lies under this sheet is a way to keep our lovely little
town just the way it is, forever. It is pure. It is perfect. Ladies
and gentleman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“My
son Harvey is looking at me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. truly looking at me for the first
time. The opacity in his eyes is gone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his face is beaming. He
is happy! My son&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>“I
give you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” 
</p>
<p>“Harvey!”
</p>
<p>And
then there was light.</p>
