For They Are the Ones Who Do the Research
</p>

<p>
I was offshore when I realized the industry was beyond any
foreseeable recovery. We were part of a multi-well workover project
in Angola, requiring twelve-hour shifts on different production
platforms. One slickline crew replaced gas lift valves, while my
coworker and I were the wireline crew which logged for hydrocarbon
saturation. 
</p>
<p>The
main offshore platform had production facilities to remove solids,
separate liquid and gas, flare excess, and prepare the different
fluids for their respective pipelines back to shore. It required a
village to run this platform, and the village lived and slept, five
weeks at a time, on their platform. The main processing platform
didn’t have any extra accommodations for workover projects. The
company sent all temporary employees and subcontractors to the
“alternative living quarters” on a satellite platform. The ALQ
consisted of shipping containers with four bunk beds, dirty linens,
and rudimentary plumbing. I hated those accommodations, and preferred
exercise to the shipping container.</p>
<p>It
was mid-December, and instead of waiting for New Year’s
resolutions, my coworkers and I constructed a makeshift gym in the
storage area. We freed up exercise space by consolidating scaffolding
to one side of the storage area, and placing non-perishable foods in
the fridge. Part of me considered the waste of refrigerating
non-perishable food. Hydrocarbons produced and electricity generated,
to be spent on unnecessary cooling. The magnitude of the waste felt
insignificant with the crash in commodity prices. Oil and gas were
cheaper every day, and I’d rather burn energy than be cooped up in
our shipping container rooms.</p>
<p>There
is little light pollution off the coast of Angola at night. The
flaring from platforms on the horizon quickly dissipated, and left a
clear view of the stars. I stared at the sky for a moment, searched
for familiarity in the stars. The glittering blackness reminded me of
the High Plains. My legs were sore from the evening workout as I took
the stairs back down to the ALQ. After I passed through the metal
door, my phone connected to the wireless network and automatically
downloaded emails. 
</p>
<p>Top
executives in the corporation I worked for exercised their stock
options. The email regarded this as good news. I took the contrarian
position. The stock plummeted thirty percent in the past week, and
would likely continue. There was more oil supply than demand. There
were more oilfield service companies than demand.  Now was not a good
time to buy. Instead of benevolence or prudence, the corporation must
have viewed this as a necessary sacrifice to shore up the stock
price. Board members contributed their pound of flesh to appease
investors. Such sacrifices to drive up prices, replacing
fundamentals. This industry was fucked. 
</p>
<p>During
the days of slickline work, the other wireline guy and I would go
fishing off the edge of the platform. The regular workers dedicated
to production operations on the platform shared their fishing lines
and lures, only asking us to donate good catches to the kitchen in
return. The ocean contained copious amounts of small blue and yellow
fish, a handful of red snappers, and one dark barracuda which swam
only near the supply boat’s landing. 
</p>
<p>Our
first attempt at fishing used our lunch scraps as bait. Only the
blue-yellow fish would bite at our meal, while the red snappers swam
around the line uninterested. I caught a smaller fish first. As I
reeled it up the dozen meters from water to the production deck, I
considered the best way to kill it. To preserve any meat, I let it
gasp for oxygen. The fish’s blue and yellow scales reflected
prismatic in the sun as the animal asphyxiated on the deck. The chef
on board refused to cook this blue-yellow fish, instead telling us to
use the carcass as bait for the red snapper. 
</p>
<p>An
asphyxiated fish does not bleed, which was necessary to attract a red
snapper. I pierced a stronger hook, made out of spare slickline,
through the smaller fish, and the fish blood ran down my wrist and
forearm. I still remember the other wireline guy frowning in disgust
as I threw the bait back to the ocean, fish blood splattering on the
railing. A red snapper immediately seized upon it. At first, I
imagined myself the hero of the day, hauling in red snapper for the
cook and other workers to eat. But the line snapped microseconds
after the red snapper took the blue-yellow fish. I repeated this
process of catching smaller fish to use as bait without help from the
other guy. He had no stomach to see fish cannibalize each other. 
</p>
<p>The
platform’s crane operator obsessed over the barracuda at the supply
boat’s landing, and referred to the fish (in his broken English) as
“the monster”. The crane operator tried the same technique for
the barracuda, whispering foreign words to himself while fishing. No
amount of smaller fish could ever entice the barracuda. It always
remained visible, an arm’s length underneath the water’s surface,
darting between steel jackets, casing, and pipelines. If our line
couldn’t withstand a snapper, what hope was there in catching the
monster? 
</p>
<p>The
company laid me off after the reservoir evaluation project. No other
jobs wanted an engineer with petroleum experience on their résumé.
I was a flight risk back to a better paying industry as soon as the
market recovered. I suppose they were right, in the end. For the next
year, my pursuit was higher education. 
</p>
<p>I
emailed two professors at two different schools, explained my
undergrad, my recent standardized test scores, and my work experience
as an oilfield engineer. Two schools: one lower-rated, safe, probable
admission, and the other in the same metro area I lived in, more
prestigious, unlikely admission. 
</p>
<p>The
lesser school’s professor replied immediately, saying, “Our ideal
candidates are students with double majors or with a history of
research funding. We received four times the normal amount of
applications this year and only have positions for ten percent. You
should focus on other schools, for which your research interests and
your background might fit better.”</p>
<p>This
lower tier school shocked me. Without doubt, others had the same idea
to train up during the downturn. Grad school would be more
competitive than I assumed. The professor from the more prestigious
engineering program emailed me back, catching me by surprise. Maybe
because I already lived in the metro area. The professor said she
wanted to meet me for coffee close to campus. 
</p>
<p>I
drove to the coffee shop she mentioned, which was a quiet walk in the
shade down the hill from her department. I stepped up to the café’s
door, decorated with diversity slogans, rainbow flags, and promises
of safety and inclusion. Once inside, I stood by the door for fifteen
minutes until I saw the professor walk up. She was short, and dressed
more like a high school art teacher than a petroleum engineering
professor.</p>
<p>“Dr.
Singh?” 
</p>
<p>“J?”
</p>
<p>After
exchanging pleasantries, we walked to the counter and ordered our
drinks. I insisted on paying, and at that moment she also picked out
a snack. We collected our items and sat down to discuss grad school.</p>
<p>“Soo
. . .” she began, “What are your research interests?” 
</p>
<p>I
regurgitated what I already provided via email: “Adsorbed state
physics. I studied chemical engineering, and worked as a field
engineer in formation evaluation. I believe unconventional resources
aren’t adequately described by current volumetric models.”</p>
<p>“Yes,
I agree. Current industry practices seem to be . . . inadequate. We
have a few students researching that subject, one particularly bright
woman from China, would you like to meet her?“</p>
<p>She
couldn’t recall any free days off the top of her head, yet promised
she would email me once she looked at her calendar. After discussing
research interests, the conversation turned to my international work
experience. 
</p>
<p>“What
was your favorite part about working overseas?” 
</p>
<p>“On
slow days, we would go fishing.” I thought back to the barracuda,
the monster almost within reach that we could never catch. I thought
about the blue-yellow fish, asphyxiated, pierced, cast from the
production deck, sunlight reflecting on scales as it fell several
meters before landing in the water. Would this professor understand
what I was talking about, or would she turn away from the idea of
fish blood running down my hands?</p>
<p>Dr.
Singh ignored most of my emails. I wrote to her five different times,
and only one of them she acknowledged, saying there would be a more
substantive email from her soon.</p>
<p>There
was one last attempt at reaching her. I decided to visit Dr. Singh’s
office uninvited, catching her by surprise. As I walked along the
campus, I searched for familiarity, and thought back to the days
spent hunting. The older buildings—tiled roofs and solid stone—were
capable of opening windows for rifles. The modern buildings, many
sponsored by oil and gas companies, had giant glass panes, but no
ability to open windows. I walked up to her office and noticed Dr.
Singh had political decorations on her door. An environmental slogan
in particular caught my eye. I always knew academia was isolated from
the economic hardships of industry, but supporting environmentalists
seemed too far detached from reality, bordering on malfeasance.  I
should have been more suspicious of these institutions of research. 
</p>
<p>She
wasn’t in. I took the hint and spent the downturn as a ski bum
instead.</p>
