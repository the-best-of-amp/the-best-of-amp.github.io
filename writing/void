<body><p>
Not long ago I was apprehended by the authorities and placed in
custody, under what is known as a fifty-one-fifty hold. This means,
at the time of my arrest, I was designated a potential danger to
myself and others. I do not recall the circumstances that brought me
apparently to carry a small, unregistered weapon into a convenience
store that night, nor the succeeding events. But I am assured by
professionals that it did in fact happen and that I was in a state of
disassociation, unable to make myself understood.</p>
<p>I am
told that this is why I have been placed here, and why I am forbidden
from leaving. Furthermore, I am required by law to attend regular
therapy sessions and to maintain a clear and honest relationship with
Glenn, my mental health coordinator. My cooperation with the program
is essential. Soon I will be able to plead my case and my sanity
before a judge at a special hearing. Then I will be free again.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Captivity
is not so bad: there are board games and puzzles and televisions
mounted in the high corners of the community spaces. They’re kept
in cages and play only black-and-white sitcoms. My room has a window,
and presently I have it all to myself (this is favorable; isolation
isn’t a problem for me and many of the other residents have issues
that keep them and their roommates up for hours during the night).</p>
<p>Because
I am an exemplary resident I am allowed to walk the premises as I
please, in and outside, with the exception of those floors restricted
for the deranged and violent. Much of the staff knows me by first
name and they find me very pleasant.</p>
<p>There
are other residents who range in their capacity for rational thought
and extended conversation. All of them are peaceful, or have at least
not expressed their violent ideation. Many of them happen to be
women, but they all differ in age and ethnic background. I have taken
a sympathetic, almost paternal role with some of them. I am one of
the few expected to leave soon and return to a productive and someday
respectable life. Naturally, they see potential in me. Perhaps they
also see a means to communicate with an otherwise hostile and alien
world waiting outside the walls. One they may never see, or
understand.</p>
<p>Several
times a week I lead a handful of the other, less capable residents on
a short walk around the exterior of the facility. There is a small
pine grove with a winding dirt path and a pond adjacent to the main
building. It is normally gray and cold out, but the fresh air is good
for all of us. I also appreciate the responsibility. The fact that
the staff trusts in me to lead the others, albeit for a short time,
has given me the confidence I’ll need to do well in my hearing and
my life outside the facility.</p>
<p>I’ve
written these thoughts down to tell Glenn at our next meeting. I
believe I’m doing very well.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Anna
is an older Spanish woman, committed by her daughter, with severe
dementia and too much energy to be left alone. I often see her
humming softly as she waddles between therapy and her scheduled
activities, followed by a solemn, attentive nurse. Elle, a younger
girl, is suicidal but making good progress. Like most young people
she can be easily coerced into talking about herself at length and I
enjoy listening, until her thoughts are broken off by tears and
sobbing and I find someone to help. Cedric is another resident
committed by the justice system, like me. His situation is tragic but
it is not at all shocking. Cedric is easily agitated and reacts to
stimuli in his mind. He avoids eye contact and mumbles. He is also
massive. Despite himself he is inherently intimidating. One can not
be in a prolonged conversation with him without the threat of an
outburst, which alienates him from the other residents. It is sad to
see, and I feel that underneath his ailment Cedric is essentially
just a very frightened young man.</p>
<p>Then,
of course, there is Bob.</p>
<p>I
meet with all of the residents on their own terms, as a comrade in
custody. I have learned much from them and I sincerely believe that
they have benefited from my attention. Unlike staff, the residents
often are not able to recognize me, due to their afflictions. I meet
with them as a stranger. Our conversations and the relations we build
dissolve with the passing of another day, and the next, and so forth.</p>
<p>It
does not deter me; I genuinely care for them. I have even considered
entering the field of mental health after my release. It speaks to
me, and it may be my true calling (another positive thing to tell
Glenn).</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Bob
is by far the most confounding resident.</p>
<p>Bob
arrived voluntarily, a long time before me. He doesn’t antagonize
any of the residents or staff but they do not seem to like him very
much. I can see why. Bob often appears irritated and resentful, but
always quiet. In the morning he gets into the same chair, every day,
for hours until it is time to go back to bed. Bob seems weary of the
rest of us and of life. The staff does not encourage him to
participate in the activities offered and they take little interest
in his overall progress. A rumor I’ve heard from Elle is that they
lock him into his own room at night, but no one knows why. I have not
seen this and cannot verify. He watches us from the corner of the
room, grimacing, hardly moving.</p>
<p>I’ve
spoken with him quite a bit.</p>
<p>Bob
explained to me that he has lived before—many times before, in
fact. So many times that he has now lost count. His life begins in a
suburb up north about fifty years ago. After his life, he dies, and
when he has died he has always woken up the next morning, an infant
again in his old familiar home.</p>
<p>Bob
says the first time he was reincarnated it was unbelievable, but
eventually he became very hopeful; who wouldn’t feel grateful to
experience their youth again, keeping all the learned wisdom of their
later years? After the initial trauma of infancy (evidently a very
horrifying experience once imbued with the consciousness of an
adult—the shock of complete helplessness: limbs and spine too weak
to do anything but struggle, the body shudders in rapid growth—bones
forming, skull sealing, teeth rising to the surface of tender
gums—all colored by the regular, unavoidable visitations of shit,
vomit, snot, emotion, etc.) his second life was generally full of
victories. He impressed his peers, displayed uncanny insight, and
reveled in sexual and financial triumph.</p>
<p>This
was repeated for the third, fourth, fifth times. After several lives
and deaths—rather, the same life leading into many different
deaths, ranging from mundane to unpredicted to horrendously,
regrettably painful—Bob started to see his situation with less
enthusiasm. The problem, Bob says, was that he was trapped. He grew
but the world around him was stuck on repeat. Immortal only in
theory, he had power but no control.</p>
<p>Somewhere
around the thousandth iteration, says Bob, that’s when the days
began to truly fade into another. He sought this place as a refuge, a
shelter from the world he was terrified to experience again.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
sought more information on Bob from the staff’s records, but
residents are not allowed access to those kinds of documents. I was
even reprimanded for being nosy—a woman behind the counter wagged
her finger threatening that this might get back to Glenn. The others
are poor sources of information. Depending on who one is asking, Bob
is either a government agent, an alien, completely invisible, or a
doppelgänger slowly trying to replace Kiki (Kiki is a paranoid
schizophrenic who typically shrieks in an inarticulate jargon—getting
any cohesive statements out of her is noteworthy, even if it yields
questionable results).</p>
<p>Kiki
had an accident once. It was on one of my walks, while she was
supposed to be under my supervision. I wasn’t paying attention and
she began to walk straight into the pond and got her ankle stuck on a
root. She fell over into the water and almost drowned in two feet of
muck because she couldn’t free herself. She was only helped after
the rest of us heard her wailing in her distinct gibberish.</p>
<p>The
staff was lenient with me but I still feel terrible. How could I
forget something so important? I’ve tried to discuss my memory
issues with Glenn, but I don’t believe he’s as concerned. As a
representative of the justice system his interest is in addressing my
antisocial tendencies and any potential access to weapons.</p>
<p>It
dawns on me that it has been some time since my last meeting with
Glenn, and it unsettles me. The specter of my upcoming hearing looms
in my mind. Will the judge be told of my mistake in letting Kiki
almost drown? Would Glenn be obligated to tell them? Should I tell
Glenn that I have dreams about it constantly—only in the dreams I
don’t hear Kiki struggling. I simply rise out of bed, run to the
pond and find her because I know she is there, lying face-up just
under the surface. She is impossibly placid—a state of being Kiki
has never known. Her expression is so stoic that at once I realize
she needs my help. I dive in, into the complete blackness where the
sound of Kiki’s screams have been hiding in wait then flood my
ears.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Bob
says he knows me already. He says that has met me in many of his
previous lives. I always tend to show up to the facility some time
after him, he says. I like to entertain the possibility that what I
can’t believe may be true, and so I ask him if I’ve changed over
all the time she’s known me. Is it possible that somehow, over a
span of different realities, like one singular passing of time—if
“I” even exists in this sense—I have grown?</p>
<p>He
does not seem confused by the question (perhaps I’ve already asked
him) but his answer is simply “no.”</p>
<p>Bob
knew my parents’ names, without me telling him.</p>
<p>I
see Glenn, but it is only in passing in the hallway. I am very
relieved to see him. I understand completely that he is the only man
here who stands in the way of me achieving my freedom. I can think
only of how to impress him, ways to assure him that I am ready and
all he needs to do is let me through. But I don’t want him to
misinterpret any of my actions. I don’t want him to know how much I
fixate on things: my hearing, my memory loss, Kiki, Bob.</p>
<p>“How
are you, Glenn?”</p>
<p>“I’m
good.”</p>
<p>“How’s
Kiki, Glenn?”</p>
<p>“She’s
good.”</p>
<p>He
is gone again.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Bob
has a nervous habit, a distinct vocal tic. Bob is generally
whisper-quiet when stuck in one of his vocal loops, but if one
listens they can hear it whispered throughout the halls of the
facility. Many of the residents have some similar sort of verbal
issue, aside from those who simply babble and scream and weep, but
Bob’s is unique. I have heard him whispering and I have asked
Bob—who seems to be a somewhat rational, if clinically delusional,
human being—what’s the deal?</p>
<p>Bob’s
tic involves repeating his own name, again and again, over and over:</p>
<p>“Bobobobobobobobobobobobobobob—”
steadily and softly.</p>
<p>I’ve
asked Bob about his private ululations and he’s elaborated: his
name is suited for this kind of repetition in many peculiar ways: it
is palindromic, and monosyllabic, for one. It is phonetically
unambiguous. Further, in repeating it so insistently, it appears to
be more than it is (<i>i.e.</i>, whereas “bobobobobob” appears to
be the repetition of “bob” five times, “bob” as a discrete
morpheme appears only three times, separated by solitary ‘o’s—a
phonemic placeholder synchronistically the same as the only one found
in the repeated morpheme, Bob’s actual name (<i>i.e.</i>, with a
different placeholding phoneme (“bobabobabobabob”) the separation
between morphemes is obvious) which ultimately has no formal
meaning—the resonant characteristic and the underlying orthogeny
still lend the utterance a quasi-spiritualistic importance as in a
mantra, or prayer, or incantation—except as Bob’s name). I admit
to Bob it is fascinating, but I still don’t understand.</p>
<p>Sometimes
I catch myself saying the word.</p>
<p>Bobobobobobobobobob.</p>
<p>Kiki
no longer accompanies me on my walks.</p>
<p>I
didn’t even notice at first, but it must be this whole week and
longer that she hasn’t been out walking behind me. Is she doing
activities? Sitting alone in her room? How can I possibly ask the
staff? To ask them is to admit I am as mentally adrift as the rest.
They will lose their faith in me and forget me. Surely they must
already know, but they smile at me like nothing is wrong. It’s
probably already too late: their deepest suspicions have only been
confirmed. I am beyond help.</p>
<p>My
hearing should be in just a few days. Glenn should know, but I can
never reach him. I have to put my trust in a man who always seems to
be in the other room. This is the nature of the system, I scoff to
myself. Bob is whispering:</p>
<p>Bobobobobob.</p>
<p>Elle
has bad dreams too. She dreams mostly about her father who used to
beat her when she was very small. The image of a man four times
larger than her, striking her viciously from above, has burned itself
in her mind. Sometimes she has dreams where she is not being
terrorized by her father exactly but by some other terrible figure
with the same imposing proportions. She says that while they aren’t
always her father they are always someone she knows. Dreams are
constrained like this; we can dream of anything, except those things
we can’t.</p>
<p>I
told her about Bob’s name.</p>
<p>“Like
Anna.”</p>
<p>I
don’t understand.</p>
<p>Elle
says that because Anna’s name is a palindrome it can exhibit the
same properties as Bob’s name, but I explain to her politely that
this is not the case: “Anna” repeated can not yield the same
verbal illusion. It is disyllabic, and the phonemes on either end are
confused—textually identical but fundamentally, deceptively
different (A1 = [æ], A2 = [ʌ]); <i>i.e.</i>, pure typographic
repetition (<i>e.g.</i>, “annaannaannaannaanna”) is clumsier,
incorporating phonetic ambiguity (<i>i.e.</i>, textual renderings
implies no phonetic difference between “anananananana” and the
aforementioned, however phonemic difference between A1 and A2
disrupts convergence of discrete morphemes) the middle of “Anna”
being not any open-mouthed, resonant ohm-like vowel but a pedestrian
sneer of disgust, the voiced nasal nnn- (opposing the complete
holistic unity of sound/signifier/significance in entity [bob])
forcing an ugly lurch of the jaw, a removal from a harmonious trance
of perfect repetition) but she doesn’t follow.</p>
<p>“What
about Kiki?”</p>
<p>What
about Kiki?</p>
<p>“Poor
Kiki,” she says almost to no-one, and stares out over the pond
through the gray air, then shrugs.</p>
<p>I
don’t understand.</p>
<p>I
want to speak to Glenn but the staff can’t tell me where he is. I
want to ask him about my hearing but the staff only wants me to calm
down and they threaten again to tell Glenn about my behavior, so I
depart quietly. It should be tomorrow or the next day and I don’t
know what to say. I don’t know how these things work and I
desperately want to seem prepared, and professional, and sane.</p>
<p>Bob
is in the corner. I don’t hear him but his lips are moving.</p>
<p>It
can sometimes be very hard to think around the other residents. I am
trying hard not to forget anything anymore, but sometimes I can’t
concentrate indoors. I have been taking more walks lately, often
unaccompanied. Luckily the staff still feels confident enough in me
to allow me this relief from my torment.</p>
<p>I
will wait outside of Glenn’s office door, for hours if I have to. I
will look crazy—even if I smile and act friendly, I will look
crazy, I know it—but I need to talk to him about my hearing. Sane
men care about their fates and about the miscarriage of justice. I
should want to be out of here because I do not belong.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
ask Bob if he’s ever considered killing himself, and he is bored by
the question. He tells me suicide was a phase he went through,
somewhere around his twentieth pass. It was there that he actually
began to lose count. He assumes it took maybe a hundred attempts to
fully realize that death wouldn’t solve his problem.</p>
<p>I
ask him what phase came next in his lives and he tells me he then
studied for a long time. Reading anything, seeking out experts in all
fields, trying to find a rational explanation—even an irrational
one, so long as it provided results. It involved less dying than his
previous phase but it was ultimately as fruitless. In his studies Bob
simultaneously gained a deep dissatisfaction with the material
universe and the facts of reality. Beyond those tiny facts, he says
with supposedly over a thousand lived years devoted purely to the
pursuit of knowledge, nothing is true nor is it relevant. Entropy
takes all but the sterile facts, rendered meaningless in their
separation from one another, with no-one to construct truth out of
the free-floating parts.</p>
<p>Bob
says that effectively everything is the same, and everything is
pointless.</p>
<p>The
dream is different now, and it’s longer. I get out of bed just the
same but now I’m looking for Glenn, wandering through the halls and
feeling the drywall for vibrations of sound. He is somewhere on the
other side of whichever one I happen to be touching. His voice is
muffled but omniscient. The syllables are all off, but somehow I know
the word he is whispering:</p>
<p>Bobobobobobob.</p>
<p>I
leave, and I feel strangely as though the pace of my movement is
out-of-tune with the beat of my steps. I am drifting, but my legs
thrash as if I’m running.</p>
<p>I
find myself at the pond, but Kiki can not be seen. The water is so
dark, and someone is standing on the other side, so I start to run
around to them. I can still hear Bob’s name whispered behind me.
She is crying, not in real words. Scrambled phonemes and poor little
whimpers. I can see the bottom of the pond, black twisted roots sunk
in the scum, but I see no Kiki.</p>
<p>I am
walking around the pond, and I believe I am awake. Bob is by my side.</p>
<p>I
ask him what is on the other side. Bob is the only man I’ve ever
known to come back from the dead with his memories: what happens
after we die?</p>
<p>He
tells me nothing happens because nothing can happen. There is no
time, no consciousness, no soul. There is nothing. I am not
surprised; I’m bored with Bob now. I feel he has little to show for
all his supposed experience. I offer him my curiosity and I plead for
advice but all he does is lead me in circles. He can’t admit it but
his mind is rotten with the age of his past lives, which of course
are themselves figments of his psychological condition.</p>
<p>My
hearing was two days ago. I don’t recall it, but I’m told I did
well. As for when I will be able to leave I hope for an answer from
Glenn. I am eager to see him, but I’m told that I have seen him,
that I see him often, and that he has only positive things to say.
I’m beginning to think it would be wrong to release me. That I
belong here. I spend more time now confined to a chair, like Bob,
with my head tilted up to one of the imprisoned televisions.</p>
<p>We’ve
reached the other side of the pond. It’s cold and quiet and the
water is too dark to see through. I can hear whispering behind me,
like the hushed sound of popping corn. It isn’t done for me but I
know Bob is aware of how it torments me. He can feel me the same way
I feel him, I can tell. I accuse him of being a fool for having been
tricked so thoroughly by me. Without really thinking I tell Bob how
his previous lives have simply been days in the facility. He is mad,
and I have been stringing him along for my own entertainment. I don’t
know why but I have the urge to hurt Bob like this, but he doesn’t
seem bothered. Instead he asks me about Kiki, and then laughs as if
he’s told a joke. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">My
dream has evolved. It has repeated itself so many times it has forced
itself to grow into something freshly disturbing. In the dream I do
nothing, and there is nothing, simply gray fog all around me
everywhere. But I feel the presence of the pond, Kiki’s body under
the water, and Bob, all somewhere out in the fog. I sit and wait for
the dream to be over, voluntarily confined. It doesn’t frighten me
but it is terrible to endure.</p>
<p>I no
longer see Elle. Residents are not privy others’ medical
information, so I cannot know what has happened to her. I believe she
has chosen to kill herself but I cannot verify. None of the other
residents seem to notice.</p>
<p>As
the days pass and I begin to lose count I think often about my
arrest, which I do not remember. I have only the words of others to
inform me as to the details of that night. The picture I have does
not make sense. My memories are too broken and I feel I can no longer
trust the flashes of the past that I do recall. Everything is
suspect. Like facts at the end of the universe, as Bob tells me,
events are disconnected in my mind and there is ultimately no “me”
that can be fabricated from the free-floating thoughts. I have been
freed, in a sense.</p>
<p>The
staff, Bob, and the occasional new resident stop by my chair. They
say things to me. They whisper in soft intonations I do not
understand, although I am confident that they are words. Fricatives
and affricates, voiced alveolars and bilabial plosives; all the same,
all pointless.</p>
