I used to race toy cars down the driveway—Hot Wheels, Matchbox and
the like. Gravity makes great toys. Newton knew this, right after
that lemon fell on his head, the first thing he does is go and make a
fortune off of “Newton’s” cradles selling them to kids claiming
he invented the forces involved. Anyway, I had my few underdog
cars—the beat-up, crooked, novelty cars—and I would always race
them against the new stuff, the hot stuff. Usually it went as
expected, and that was fine, but every now and then the pavement
would fare just right and the little car that could would become a
champion. The neighborhood kids didn’t get it, and mom would tell
me to just throw the broken cars out, but like they always say: when
life gives you lemons. 
</p>
<p>This
attitude towards toy cars no doubt grew in me as I reached the age
for real ones. There was something about a reliable used Toyota Camry
that just irked me the wrong way. Two years and two old BMWs later, I
had ingrained in me traumatic memories of heat gauges, unable to take
my eye off them even as a passenger. Weird German car parts haunted
my nights like a late-for-school dream. <i>I’m sorry Mr. Radiator
but I forgo—no please anything but the heat, please don’t</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One hot summer day, during my college years, the artsy hoe from
philosophy 101 was blowing me in the back seat of my 1970 BMW 02, and
it didn’t feel like it should have. The parallel lines of my orgasm
and the car temperature gauge crossed at the wrong time in my mind
and I was left gasping for air, anxious, limp dick, sweating all over
the leather. My therapist thought it was funny, but there was nothing
funny about it. One day, tired of paying for his worthless sessions,
I stole his notebook and left him for good. It was filled with weird
doctor scribbles that I slowly deciphered sitting in the sunbaked car
before driving home. You want to know what they said? “Life very
impotent after ‘lemon laid.’” 
</p>
<p>Performance
anxiety is killer, especially without a shrink. It can catch you
anywhere in life, and it tends to seep into weird situations, like
ordering coffee from the cute girl at Dunkin Donuts or singing happy
birthday when not everyone is joining in. The pervasive level it
reached all came to a head in this weird dream I had. In it, I was
the freshest, newest star on Saturday Night Live. It was my first day
and I was holding a little paper itinerary, desperately trying to be
at the right set at the right time. Everyone else was Tina Fey. You
might think, <i>that sounds kind of fun</i>. Well, you’d be wrong.
Think about it: Tina Fey is known for making fun of herself, <span style="font-style: normal">there
is a whole show about it</span>, you look at her and say <i>wow, I’m
more comfortable about being me</i>. Now imagine there are hundreds
of them watching you, making faces, scolding you, grimacing when your
one-liner doesn’t hit, when you have to look down to read the joke
off your paper, when you’re late to the next set and the show is
LIVE FROM NEW YORK! During the music break a majestic choir of Feys
rose up from the studio audience and sang in crimson light contrasted
by darkened sets and a now grim cast. I couldn’t take it anymore, I
was on the ground crumpled, crying pitifully, <i>why won’t she
relate, why can’t she understand?</i> But then the true Fey stepped
forward, from the homogeny of the choir. She knelt down and held me
in her arms kissing the top of my head as only a mother could. I
reciprocated by holding her breasts like a son probably shouldn’t
do, but it was okay, it was Tina Fey, she thought it was funny. At
the same time the choir was rising, swelling, and they sang: “when
Liz gives you Lemons, grab them, don’t let them get awaaaaaay.”</p>
<p>Not
to imply I completely rid myself of impotency after the dream, but
jerking it to 30 Rock really seemed to help out. That being said, I
had to go to quite some lengths to find the episodes. This was back
in the day where you had to be resourceful when pirating. The
internet wasn’t quite big enough to have everything yet. On top of
that, for some reason people didn’t know how to spell, or spelled
wrnog on purpose, Limewire file names littered with everything but
the actual content. It didn’t stop me though, I made my own program
to search for each possible anagram of each character or word that
was even slightly related to the show. It was through these searches
that I found lots of interesting unrelated files. Recombinations of
Jenna Maloney gave me gigabytes of quality <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px;">maryjane_x_spider-man</span>
porn, and it was through Pete Hornberger that I learned about God,
his brethren, and finally repented. Most importantly I found my
favorite band of all time, Blind Lemonz, and like they say:

<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><i>I
don’t understand why I sleep all day </i>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><i>And
I start to complain that there’s no rain </i>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><i>All
I can do is have a drink in the shade </i>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><i>And
it rips my life away </i>
