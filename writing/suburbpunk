<p>
When I was about seven years old, my father took me out behind our
house where our backyard met a sort of wooded forest; I doubt it
could be called that but the woods were thick enough that past a
certain point you couldn’t see the other side, so we collectively
called it the woods. By that time I had only tread through there
supervised, and my father’s massive, uncoordinated steps that hit
every possible bump in the path scared away any and all wildlife, so
I often believed them to be sterile. So when my father told me to
stop in the grass and pointed downwards, I was in shock to find a
dead bird.</p>
<p>I
could recognize the form of a bird of course, I had seen a nature
documentary when I was a child in school while a substitute covered
for our teacher; it was a bird, I didn’t know the name of it
though. It was a gray, almost cement like color with small red dashes
across its face. I stared at it quietly, waiting for it to stand up
and fly away. I asked my father why it wasn’t moving, staring up
into eyes that <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">feigned</span></span>
sympathy to my naïveté—<i>feigned</i> being the focal point. I
doubt my father ever felt empathy or sympathy for me, much less love.
I suppose this was his way of trying to teach his child even if he
didn’t particularly care for my presence. But I stared up at him
for the longest time, and he waited until I was tugging on his
pants-leg, begging for an answer.</p>
<p>He
crouched down next to me, in that way fathers do to their oft smaller
sons and told me it was dead. “Dead?” I asked; I had a vague
conception of the word. When I’d hear my mother’s favorite actor
was dead or some sort of cowboy western star was dead, I’d hear a
sigh or a groan from either of them depending on who it was. It
wasn’t something they enjoyed—I could gather that much. I asked
my father if he liked the bird’s movies, and he looked genuinely
angry at me for a brief moment—a brief moment he had hoped I hadn’t
seen but I had seen clear as day before he had taken back his
composure. He explained to me that actors didn’t just die, everyone
did. I asked when they’d be coming back. He said they never did. I
asked why that was; he told me that was the way things were. I asked
where they went, and he said he didn’t know and no one did. It
shifted then, to how people die; he told me they died the same way
animals did. Sometimes they just got sick and never got better.
Sometimes they got hurt too much and they never healed. Sometimes
they died because they couldn’t eat or drink. They died the same as
us, he said. I asked if he would die, and he said one day. I asked
how the bird died, and he said it hit a window and broke its leg. I
asked when I’d die, imploring that I wanted to leave (I had meant
the current conversation, but he took it in a much different light).</p>
<p>He
looked at me with concern; be it genuine concern or concern for the
consequences of a child’s death on him I wasn’t sure. He told me
to stay outside while he called mom; I think at the time she was out
getting groceries at one of those big gray block stores. I sat out
there and stared at the bird. I had been roused out of my bed by my
father that morning specifically to see this, and I sat down so I
could get a good look. I wondered if I was going to be punished.
Normally when he called mom like this, it meant I had given him
“lip”. The morning dew pressed against my flannel pajamas,
soaking the skin underneath. I touched and poked the bird, grabbing
the leg to try and see where it had been broken. The leg looked
complete to me, so I tried to readjust it to see if maybe it had just
been misplaced. As I set to this task, the thing twitched. Looking
back upon it it was probably just the muscles being stimulated, the
last impulses of nerves kicking the thing, but I couldn’t
understand that. It was supposed to be dead. It was moving. A wave of
revulsion moved over me and my arm spasmed as the thing was propelled
away from me. I crawled cautiously, making sure that in its alive
state it could not harm me; it lay on its back, the leg I grabbed
twisted in a disgusting unnatural way. Across the neck was a great
bloody gash—my father had lain it on its back purposefully. Perhaps
the thing had broken its leg, but that’s not how it died. It
wouldn’t have gotten better, I know that now, but I thought then
that my father had made the thing dead—I did not know the word
“kill” quite yet—instead of what he had told me.</p>
<p>Did
all things look like that when they died? 
</p>
<p>My
father owned a singular firearm I remember seeing. It was a
snub-nosed .38 revolver, one he told me he paid 50 dollars for when
my mother and him had gotten married in ‘94. An old friend had sold
it to him, when he sought protection for their first apartment
together. It was an ugly, mass produced piece that he didn’t trust
to hit something past 20 feet. I remember because he had told me to
get in the car one Sunday when I was nine and we drove off to a
deserted field, an hour away from home. Setting up some bottles on a
piece of plywood about chest level, he put my hand on the revolver
and showed me how to aim. He told me to then breathe out, and pull. I
did. There was no concussive blast, no bottle breaking. Just a dry
fire. He said I did good and put a round in. I remember the round
being silver, an aluminum casing with a fine, sharp point on the end,
that being the actual bullet. I did as he told me, and pulled down
the trigger. The gun kicked hard enough to not only propel itself out
of my hand, but hit me in the face as well. It didn’t break
anything, but a nasty bruise was left. I went home and he got me a
soda with the advice to tell my mother I was just playing ball with
some friends and got hit by the ball. I told mom this and she asked
where I made friends. I said out in the field dad took me too. They
yelled at each other that night.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">I
have a distinct memory of the first time I was suspended. I was on
the playground when I was 11, in fifth grade. I wasn’t a
particularly large child, but kids instinctively avoided me as if I
looked like I could beat them up. I was sitting on the swings; it was
an overcast sort of day, one that occurred often in the first few
months of spring. The memory itself is very clear. A light wind
propelled my swing forward and back. I didn’t much care to actually
swing as much as I wanted a place to sit that wasn’t covered in
that horrid mulch. I remember hearing some of that very same mulch
crunching outside of my peripheral vision; it was rare other kids
used the swings, but I wasn’t opposed to anyone’s presence. I
heard a snickering before the child quietly called me a faggot. I had
no actual reference for what the word meant besides when one stick
figure was angry at another in a flash animation, he called the other
guy that and punched him. I thought I was going to be punched.</p>
<p>I
got off the swing as if the metal was going to stick to my skin and
burn me alive before I turned to face the child. He was maybe an inch
or two shorter than me, and a bit thinner too; had his ploy worked,
he would’ve only had the advantage of surprise. I charged him,
intent on making sure he couldn’t say that word to me again while
he asked if he could borrow my swing. The voice he had called me a
faggot in was different from the one he had before he realized what I
was doing. 
</p>
<p>Then
the sentence changed to a scream, and I was upon him. I had no
knowledge of fighting. All I knew is that things were dead when you
made their throat red, so I took my nail and started dragging it
across his Adam’s apple while he screamed, occasionally thrashing
my legs to keep him down. He screamed, loud piercing ones, low cries
for help for about a minute until a teacher came over and tore me off
of him. She grabbed me and took me to the principal’s office, this
near death-grip on my arm, turning the flesh pale around it; the
clouds did not clear that day, nor the next or the one after that.
The principal asked me why I attacked him. I said he called me a
faggot, and at this he balked; as he gasped I continued. He had
called me a faggot—this I already covered, and as one knows, when
you get called that you get attacked shortly afterwards. I had to
protect myself before he attacked me. The principal asked if I knew
what faggot meant, and I said I hadn’t any idea, except I had seen
people get called it before they got punched. He said I shouldn’t
say it and I agreed. 
</p>
<p>He
told me that the child I attacked—I later learned his name was
Andrew or something to that effect—stated that he had not called me
such a thing. I stated I heard it. We began a shouting match until he
called my mother and she picked me up. I didn’t attend school for
the latter half of that week while my mother fervently called
psychiatrists. I sat in a doctors office about two months after that,
and I clearly remember going somewhat excitedly because the office
was right next to a fast food place and my mother would get me a
burger after each visit. About 3 weeks after my last visit the
doctors gave mom a call. I didn’t know what they said until I read
the report a few weeks later when she left it out in the open on her
desk. I remember my father came into the house and when he saw me
sitting on the couch he gave me a disgusted look. It was the same
sort of sneer I think I had when I looked at the bird after I had
thrown it. He yelled at mom and said something about a “retarded
son” if I remember correctly, and left the house for the night.
About three weeks later my father filed for divorce. 
</p>
<p>I
was taken out and homeschooled till the end of fifth grade. No one
ever told me what I did wrong; I assumed I had just misinterpreted
the kid’s intentions. My mother talked extra delicately to me while
my father was out of the house. Sometime in July of that year their
divorce was finalized. I had to testify my father had never hit me,
he had taken me out to that field to shoot his gun, I had been
injured—the whole spiel. It was around this time I was beginning to
grow exasperated with my parents’ constant bickering, so when my
mother brought up my violent outburst—I remember the term <i>outburst</i>
being used specifically—and she said it was inspired by my father
and his uncaring nature, I did not disagree. She argued that the gun,
being originally meant to protect her, should come to her, and
whatever ruling body presided over the case agreed. My mother got the
.38 revolver and my dad got the car and half the finances. My dad
called me a faggot as he left the courtroom and my mother grabbed me
by the arm; she was growing older, and puberty was beginning to take
its first breaths into me, and I escaped and slugged my father a
little bit below the centre of his chest but above the stomach. He
was restrained by his lawyer and I was restrained by my mother who
had gotten a hold of me once more.</p>
<p>When
I found the paper it said “Diagnosis: MDD-infrequent psychosis;
possible autism.”</p>
<p>My
mother began giving me what I later found out were antidepressants
right before sixth grade started, when she shifted me back into
public schooling. I didn’t notice any effect—but my mother
frequently doted on me after this. Well into 8th grade she commented
on how respectful and well behaved I was as opposed to when I was
younger. I felt indifferent to it, mostly. People would often call me
names in the hall, not friends of Andrew as much as people who simply
didn’t like me. I was indifferent to that as well; days with lunch
foods I liked, good test grades, bad test grades, the time my
grandfather died; it was all some sort of melodramatic monotonal
emotional haze. A particularly sharp memory was the time I was asked
on a date my freshman year.</p>
<p>I
can’t remember her name—rather I’ve sort of erased it; I didn’t
particularly care for what happened and I don’t want to remember it
so over the few years since I’ve ruthlessly suppressed it. I do
know that she had dyed red hair and a backpack with band patches all
over it. She told me she thought I was cute and asked if I wanted to
see a movie that Friday night. I asked my mother if I could go&zwj;—not
so much as I wanted to as much as she may have found something
enjoyable about the fact I was asked out—and she agreed to take me.
I was there at the time she requested and she messaged me to go to
the specific theatre. I sat next to her as she requested; the actors
on screen would do something funny and she would laugh and I
wouldn’t. They’d kiss, and out of my peripheral I could see her
looking at me in a strange manner. The film credits reeled and as I
walked out she asked if I wanted to go on another date. I said I
didn’t much care either way and she started crying. I asked why she
was crying, I didn’t say no—and she said I was a shit-head. All
of her friends gave me dirty looks the next day—my mother asked how
it went and I told her it was fine.</p>
<p>Behind
the movie theatre was this massive field; it ran out alongside power
lines and a road, a few hundred yards out. It ran parallel to the
road and the properties surrounding the mall for miles. I remember
that my mother expecting me to get dinner with her afterwards gave me
a rather liberal time for her to pick me up. I wandered the area
behind the mall for an hour under the moonlight—I walked out a mile
that night and found the gift of a vast field of flowers—I didn’t
know their names. Red leaves with a yellow centre; they had no
distinctive smell about them but the soft leaves gave me the
information I needed nonetheless. I think that was one of the first
times I could say something was beautiful; as I wandered back to the
parking lot all I could think about was their smooth surface, the
beautiful muted red under that pale light. I wrote my final English
project that year on them, and it was not long before my mother began
buying me books on Botany.</p>
<p>I
visited it a total of five times in my sophomore year. My life at the
time was this indifferent haze, as it had been since middle school,
but there was this brief moment of clarity I experienced at the
flowers. When my grandmother died and my mother gave me her
ashes—according to her I was her favorite grandson (albeit her only
grandson)—I buried it out there among the flowers. I remember with
clarity that day, as I have so many others. As I clawed at the dirt a
little bit outside—fall was coming and it was beginning to get a
bit rigid with the cold—I heard crunching. A shadow darted behind a
tree and I put the capsule quickly into the small hole I dug before I
ran off. 
</p>
<p>I
carried my mothers revolver every time I went to the field after
that. She never put a lock on it, nor was it particularly
well-hidden. She kept it in a shoebox in her closet; whenever she’d
get blackout drunk it was relatively easy to sneak it away for my
walks. Those times became all the more frequent when she lost her
job—although she acquired a new one the health insurance benefits
were nowhere near as good. Drunk one night, as she stared up into my
eyes—without expression or emotion—she said I was her burden. I
was a burden to my father; that was why he left. She called me a
psycho before vomiting on her dress and I went back to my room. I
remember she cried for a few days every time she looked at me
afterward. Partway in the summer after my sophomore year she stopped
giving me pills. I feel like my mother may have loved me—perhaps
still does—but it is painful.</p>
<p>It
was my junior year of high school when I killed my father. 
</p>
<p>Out
there—among the flowers lay I. I had come to visit the ashes to a
small degree, but the beauty of the flowers too was a powerful
motivator. Over the winter I had gradually noticed my simple lack of
feeling fading; my grandmother has been gone for some time now and I
figured I ought to visit that spot. It was the end of fall; snow
hadn’t yet made its appearance but the trees were bare, lifeless;
the ground bore no color. I stood out there in my coat and looked
over the flowers, dying, most colorless. I heard that crunching
again—I couldn’t see that shadow as I had before, but I turned
around.</p>
<p>There
stood my father; I had not seen him since the court hearing but the
time since then weathered him. What was once a healthy beard turned
into a scraggly stubble, eyes loose and darting, with purple bags
almost printed onto his skin. He recognized me before I recognized
him. 
</p>
<p>The
flowers were poppies; my mother’s botany books told me that much.
They had a usage for opium. I think that was why he was out here. I
couldn’t be certain. He had somehow gained weight, lost it, grown
haggard yet fat, pale yet all too sun-burnt. His very form seemed to
radiate a deep-rooted sickness. I grabbed the pistol out of my pocket
and shot him in the throat; there were no words exchanged between the
two of us. He was knocked flat on his back, gasping for a brief
moment. I stood over him.</p>
<p>The
blood from his throat formed a red line across the length of it, and
poured onto the poppies. He kept staring at me. Gasping. Not a word
came from his lips. I crouched down next to him like he did to me as
I stared at that bird, and wondered if he even remembered me.</p>
<p>Those
uncaring, sneering eyes he once bore at me I could see reflected in
his pupils, as they began to slow. I hated him. I hated him so much.
I pulled the hammer back one more time, and I prepared to burst open
his skull. He couldn’t even tell who I was. I wouldn’t be
surprised if he didn’t know he was dying. I cocked the hammer back
again, my first effort finding an empty chamber, and levelled the
bore at his skull. I couldn’t pull the trigger again I found—I’d
splatter the poppies. I let him sit there. There was a good minute of
his gasping before he quieted down, and eventually his twitching
stopped. He didn’t move again, not like that bird did. 
</p>
<p>I
called the cops and reported a druggie attacked me. They didn’t
question the revolver. They asked if I knew I killed my father. I
said I couldn’t recognize him. The prosecution for me didn’t have
a client that day—his body was at a morgue. My mother pleaded that
I perceived him as a threat, that I was easily scared, there was
something wrong with me. The jury pleaded not guilty of murder. I was
put in counselling for the next two years.</p>
<p>I
don’t go to the poppy field anymore—my indifference has finally
returned to me.</p>
