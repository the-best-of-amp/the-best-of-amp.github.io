I was falling from the sky. Not free-falling, no, but imagine instead
a submarine on a calculated trip to the ocean floor. No leaks through
the hull, no panicked crewmembers on the verge of
claustrophobia-induced insanity, but instead a routine survey at the
bottom of the sea mediated by calm, experienced sailors. Supporting
me on my descent were these hairless humanoids, holding me by my
forearms. Their skin was covered in scales that shone in a spectrum
from blue to yellow, depending on which angle you looked at them, and
their jet-black lips were no larger than a pen clip, yet entirely
capable of emoting along with their mostly human eyes and facial
muscles. The men and women only differed in height and the presence
or absence of featureless, almost imperceptibly small breasts; their
crotches were all smooth and bare. As I was studying the anatomy of
the one holding my right forearm to guess its sex, the Earth’s
surface—or whatever planet we were on—emerged from the fog. Pink
specks were shuffling in a flesh-tone ocean, like a carpet of maggots
on a wet pile of trash.  A smell of rank sweat and stale urine hit
me. Turning to the being on my right again, I asked where they were
taking me in desperation. The floating entity didn’t say a word,
but instead smiled and flickered its eyes like an aged light bulb.
Suddenly, I was drained of all desire. I had the notion that this
rush of contentment wasn’t mine, but I accepted the feeling of
serenity with abandon. I lost awareness of everything, fear of
everything, of where I was, of who I was, of where I was sinking to.
All of my anxiety gave way to unquestioning trust in the opalescent,
levitating gecko-woman holding me and the living ocean it was slowly
leading me towards—until individual outlines started to emerge from
the vibrating mass below. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">The
brownish maggots were disembodied penises the size of grown men.
Twitching, writhing, ejaculating, deaf, blind. I wanted to scream,
but I clenched my teeth and bit my tongue instead, afraid the ones
holding me would loosen their grip reflexively. Maybe all of the
penises below wanted to scream too, I thought—even if they had the
mouths and lungs to do so, they wouldn’t so much as hear their own
cries. The stench multiplied and made my unblinking eyes water. 
</p>
<p>Another
group of floating lizard-people were carrying someone that looked
like last semester’s linear algebra professor down into the
ceaselessly spurting abyss. As much as I tried to deny it, he wasn’t
struggling or crying. No, he didn’t show the slightest sign of
resistance. Until all I could see of his head was his signature
comb-over as he fell further below, I saw him smiling from ear to
ear. His feet were dangling carelessly, like he was on a ski lift. 
</p>
<p>The
shiny flying reptilians pushed apart some of the penises to reveal
the dark green ground that resembled the translucent glass on an old
wine bottle. When his soles touched it, his legs crumpled like a
flattened paper crane, its distinct muscles and bones all warping
into a vaguely spherical heap. His abdomen then protruded, covering
his contorted lower limbs entirely, leaving a pair of wrinkled lumps
the same size and shape as slightly deflated beach balls directly
below his belly button. The concave depression where his stomach once
was then flattened out like a tooth filling. The volume to occupy the
cavity was taken from his arms and hollowed flaps of skin were left
behind.  
</p>
<p>The
armless creature with nascent testicles for legs still exuded that
chilling serenity. He looked up at the beings that brought him there,
which had risen to a distance far enough to not be ejaculated on, and
smiled again, beaming in a way foreign to an ageing academic.
Carelessly wide-eyed, he then turned to face me. The disfigured
scholar held eye contact with me for what felt like an eternity,
until I heard a sharp snap through the cacophony of meaty, dull
slaps. 
</p>
<p>His
spine collapsed. His face froze in that satisfied expression and then
smashed into the newly wrinkled skin of his scrotum. A new layer then
grew to encompass the rest of his limp body, now a beige rather than
a dark, wood-like brown, reaching above his head and pinching tightly
like an end of a sausage. Everything above and including his
shoulders fused into each other, becoming a single cylindrical mass.
The area around his head expanded until all the skin covering it
stretched taut into a bell-like shape. 
</p>
<p>The
other man-penises then tumbled back into place as if they were
welcoming him. I watched the writhing mass with bated breath,
expecting the grizzled intellectual to break free from his
foreskin-cocoon and fly upwards to grab me by the hand so we could
escape together, miles above this obscene Hell. A rope of semen
soaked the sole of my right foot, but my attention didn’t waver.
Finally, something started to emerge from below. 
</p>
<p>Were
his legs unfolding to support his own weight? Were his arms growing
back to push the squirming masses away? Was that beige mass his
shoulders rising from that fetid pit? Of course not. I was
embarrassed to have even entertained the thought once an engorged,
pink bell emerged from the swelling lump.  
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Shaft
supported by its testicles, I absent-mindedly stared down the barrel
of its urethral meatus in a nauseated stupor. Upright for probably
the last time, it jerked back and forth, but still stood until a
white jet shot towards me with a visceral squelch and submerged my
head and chest in a salty sludge. I screamed immediately, but a
split-second later reduced my wails to a muffled whine once a viscous
rivulet of the professor’s goo fell into my mouth. Through a
translucent film covering my eyes, I could hardly make out the
unknowing assailant fall supine into the indistinct masses. 
</p>
<p>To
my relief, the semen wasn’t transformative, but only telepathic. I
now understood that every one of the erupting heaps below were once
people, men and women alike. Yes, the mutagenic, glassy soil below
them supported their metabolic needs in every respect, meaning they
all would ejaculate and twitch about until the sun burnt out. No,
they weren’t suffering; it was a deaf-blind, nigh-eternal ecstasy
for every turgid penis. Silent and invisible expressions of
otherworldly pleasure were psychically transferred through
skin-to-skin contact and sperm-borne transmission to make the
euphoria from the continuous, body-wide orgasms communal. 
</p>
<p>A
wetness exploded from my thighs and I tensed up from head to toe like
a tetanus patient. They weren’t communicating non-verbal moans, but
instead transferred every aspect of their emotions with them.  The
twitches and ejaculate sprays from orgasms, in other words, shared
their ecstasy from of a body-wide orgasm to anyone in the vicinity.
Others were then brought to climax to perpetuate an ecstatic,
decadent eternity.</p>
<p>They
were just as clueless about the role of the airborne humanoids that
condemned them to the fleshy abyss, if not more in the dark about
their origins and motivations. It was even less of a concern to them,
obviously. They could never turn back. They could never want to. 
</p>
<p>But
as the dreamer here, this was ultimately my world. As I had made the
man-penises and their temptations, so was I able to escape them. The
entities that had brought me there, as merely creations of mine,
broke their grip the moment I started to wrestle my arms from them. 
</p>
<p>Then,
I flew. I flew until the penises were obscured again by their
body-heat-induced steam. I flew until the scaly beings fell behind. I
flew until the grey planet fell behind. I flew until I woke up.</p>
