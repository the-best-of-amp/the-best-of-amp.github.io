<p class="justify">&ampamp was a literary magazine written, read, and edited by users of 4chan’s literature board, /‍lit‍/, and published nearly all submissions without prejudice, revealing a thin slice of the board’s culture and psyche. This is an unofficial compilation of the best writing to appear in issues 001-014 of &ampamp magazine, selected by users of /‍lit‍/.
</p>
<p class="justify" style="margin-top:-13px;">
Over fifty pieces of writing were winnowed down from the span of &ampamp, selected based on their calibre as well as for their representation of the magazine and the board. For their appearance in the best-of, these pieces of writing have been fully edited and re-illustrated, stripped back from their original presentation in &ampamp to appear here in austere greyscale. In total they form a hundred letter-sized pages representative of a small microcosm as it existed from December 2020 to July 2022, at times obscene and absurd, at other times sentimental and endearing, and in total much more than all of that, presented here as an attempt at a cohesive whole.

<b>Note on reading the PDF:</b>
the best-of was designed around two-page spreads, so if you're reading it as a PDF you should ensure that it shows correctly; left pages should be odd and right pages should be even, and ideally you should only be viewing two at a time. This two-page layout should produce legible body text in fullscreen at a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels or higher, even a little less.
